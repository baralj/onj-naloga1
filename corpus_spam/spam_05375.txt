if you want light to come into your life you need to stand where it is shining there is little difference in people but that little difference makes a big difference the little difference is attitude the big difference is whether it is positive or negative hate it has caused a lot of problems in this world but has not solved one yet take chances make mistakes thats how you grow pain nourishes your courage you have to fail in order to practice being brave hate it has caused a lot of problems in this world but has not solved one yet when the world pushes you to your knees youre in the perfect position to pray
