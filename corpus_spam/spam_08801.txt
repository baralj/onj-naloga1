perspectives amp solutions june click for complete document although there is much in the world to be proud of we still face enormous societal environmental and economic challenges even in this day and age more than billion people a quarter of all humankind lack access to even the most basic elements of life that most of us take for granted such as clean water sanitation and energy while million people more than one in ten of us remain undernourished at its most extreme the picture is infinitely worse million people again almost one in ten of us still live below the poverty line on less than per day a sum that many of us spend on a coffee without a second thought more than of children younger than age million still lack access to a complete education and are denied the opportunity to reach their full potential beyond the obvious impact on their own lives what benefits might almost a billion extra people bring to the world the united nations sustainable development goals aim to tackle the challenges issues and injustices facing the world by but the goals themselves are complex they are arguably all inextricably linked with numerous feedback loops not all of them positive trillions of dollars of capital wants to invest but struggles to translate an investment philosophy which desires alignment with the into a practical investment strategy given that complexity this report tries as far as possible to simplify the to examine those to determine the driving forces and resulting benefits and thereby determine a set of critical paths our pathways to success which can lead quickly and most effectively to the achievement of the goals it allows us to identify who is best placed to do what from the public sector to the private sector to the investment community and what their route in might be we examine the goals individually attempting to lay out both the incremental financial of achieving the goal and the human benefit that might be gained by solving it in a world of scarce resources it also provides an indication of which paths might achieve the broadest human benefit for the least financial cost though this does not mean these are the most important it is not by accident that all roads on our pathways to success lead to the eradication of poverty we identify incremental physical investment needs or opportunities in water energy and the circular economy alone of trillion per year while social investment areas of education health and hunger add up to an annual incremental opportunity of billion to be sure these are enormous sums but much smaller than the sums of capital looking to invest and tiny in relation to the human benefits that could be achieved we also examine the innovative financial instruments and frameworks needed to allow that capital to flow to aid in the achievement of the goals the represent the challenge of our generation but a challenge which we should embrace as the benefits for those suffering most as well as to the whole global community would be immeasurable if we were to succeed by identifying the lowest hanging fruit the feedback loops the critical paths the scale of the opportunity in both human and financial terms and who might do what we hopefully break the sometimes daunting down into a a framework which allows all elements of society from to and the financial community to set out in partnership down a pathway to a better fairer wealthier more inclusive cleaner and more sustainable world that we can be truly proud to leave for our children questions about gps contact your
