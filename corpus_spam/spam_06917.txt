email gps report kathleen april sustainable cities beacons of light against the shadow of unplanned urbanization gps global perspectives amp solutions april click for complete document as theodore parker once said cities have always been the fireplaces of civilization whence light and heat radiated out into the dark while great cities have shaped our civilizations over the millennia sucking in resources both natural and human before radiating them out to the world through commerce and culture this received wisdom that cities are the engines of growth is we believe failing cities may generate of global currently but while they have historically pulled in resources as they grew via industrialization this phase of urbanization is being driven as much by populations being pushed into cities by rural poverty and depravation this switch to growth being the engine of cities has profound implications it is the people that need the city not the city that needs the people some billion people representing of the global population currently live in cities the un expects this to grow by billion by and billion by by which time of us will be living in cities to put that in context that is one and a half extra chinas or or six extra all living in cities over the next years cities may only occupy of our global landmass but they already consume of all global resources and generate of direct emissions these new urban populations will require basic services such as water energy sanitation food and housing as well as the luxuries of employment education culture and recreation what impact will an extra billion people add the challenge though is even greater than this of our billion new urbanites billion will come from asia and million from africa these cities already have chronically limited revenue bases and offer meager services even to those already living there with the lack of accompanying economic growth and financial contribution from this new populous how can cities finance the vast investment needed to accommodate them if these rapidly growing cities cannot finance themselves through income and if central governments will not contribute more then the capital must come externally and so with challenge comes opportunity the good news is that trillions of dollars in capital is looking to invest in assets especially if they are focused and what an opportunity in our gps report infrastructure for growth from october we estimated that global infrastructure spend to was trillion with the bulk of that urban but cities are not just about physical infrastructure they are about people and hence there is a similarly vast social spending opportunity so how do we make it happen in this report we contrast the vicious and virtuous circles of urban investment and set out our seven steps for sustainable cities which examine how cities can make the most of the money which they have and gain access to greater funding via innovative new financial structures those seven steps will require central governments industry the financial community and cities to all do their part to tackle what is one of the greatest challenges of the coming decades with much of the infrastructure yet to be built and with a typical life span of years our choices now may resonate over centuries we have the opportunity to reshape our future by creating new and sustainable cities which can once again operate as beacons of light radiating out into the world or we can let the darkness of unplanned urban squalor continue to sprawl as aristotle once said a great city is not to be confounded with a populous one let us seize the opportunity to ensure that our cities of the future are once again truly great cities and beacons of light and not just populous ones
