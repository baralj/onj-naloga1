not sure the information is readily available if available at all data is only maintained without extraordinary measures for months it is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced i think once we asked the shipper to move the activity to another point but that was pre unfortunately because of the how the work the pack draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use also the hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use to improve system conditions sometimes we miss the mark either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight an was not may have some additional insight in more recent am not sure i understand the question do you mean at anytime we call on volumes we not allocate the guess the question is have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods we want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have gas flowing theatrically we argue that we would not call on if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements we want to verify that the theory and the actual match up i hope this makes sense thanks you are correct the changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of contracts will not impact primary firm shippers what do you need to verify and support this shippers contract marketing ventures nov texaco gas marketing nov energy resources nov marketing jun energy marketing co marketing ventures nov texaco gas marketing nov el paso merchant energy nov united inc nov engage energy american nov are the contracts that were provided during the due diligence id like to be able to verify and support that the changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority for these contracts do not result in an impact to primary firm shippers your assistance would be greatly appreciated thanks mw
