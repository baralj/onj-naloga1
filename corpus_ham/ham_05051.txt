more tool in your it comes to deciding between extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by info the points scored by position data is from get to game to avoid and passing game vs tennessee a fitting way to wind down the season sunday as jon and combined for passing yards and had of wow when you throw it times most every receiver will and thats what happened sunday peter was very active maybe the benching helped in week the titans rank in allowed per game over the last weeks so this is enticing have to wonder if can do it again for the year tennessee ranks fantasy points allowed to and fantasy points allowed to the to see where we rank these guys but clearly its passing game vs indianapolis only put up yards passing sunday but it was enough expect do better this week rod smith is of course the man here and hell too the colts rank in passing yards allowed per game over weeks for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to fantasy points allowed to passing game vs denver came up small in the yardage department with under yards he did run in one score marvin harrison is of course the clear cut goto guy a competitor and youd have to think hell give a in the final week with nothing but pride to play for the in passing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for they rank fantasy points allowed to and fantasy to louis passing game vs atlanta showed last week hell let his guys play regardless of situation i think see warner in for at least a half much more and like marshall a half of warner is better thana full game from most other players picking the wr is a lottery shot bruce or hakim are all liable to go off the falcons rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the rank fantasy points allowed to and fantasy points passing game vs new england imagine youre in week with many carolina guys on the did ok last week its tough when youre upset about isaac missing time but thats where they are both he and could miss the last game the patriots rank in passing per game over the last weeks so theyre definitely the year they rank fantasy points allowed to and allowed to its a good simply because new england hasnt been much on defense i have little faith in the carolina players advantage of the passing game vs jacksonville you think its going to be all anthony thomas jim miller and game decided to show off miller put up yards and as continued to roll marty booker continues to see lots more any other bear although david seems to make the most of what hes thrown the jaguars rank in passing yards allowed per game last weeks for the year they rank fantasy points allowed and fantasy points allowed to passing game vs detroit morgan showed some very nice flashes sunday hitting joey galloway seems to be the wr of choice hes worth a gamble the lions rank in passing yards allowed per game over the weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and fantasy points allowed to so its a nice it all whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it one the cowboys will be doing all they can to get smith his season so that may be a city passing game vs seattle green quietly carried some ff teams sunday with and finally put together a game like weve been expecting times as many passes as the maybe thatll continue this rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to and points allowed to passing game vs buffalo posted a couple of with his yards which isnt chambers jed weaver and all saw time but seemed to be the primary receiver with catches look for him to more as smith struggles the bills rank in passing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to and fantasy points allowed to england passing game vs carolina had a week to get ready for the carolina defense two drastically different directions here terry glenn could continue an impact and you know troy browns ready the panthers rank yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the year fantasy points allowed to and fantasy points allowed passing game vs kansas city is but if trent isnt the most under in the i dunno who is hes won a jillion games including lately and all he did sunday was throw and save the at least for another week the big question is will he get is saying he wants to play stay tuned went nuts last week and if gets the nod you have to at him the chiefs rank in passing yards allowed per game last weeks for the year they rank fantasy points allowed and fantasy points allowed to francisco passing game vs new orleans threw for and against a tough cowboy pass defense plus he rushed for another td is a must stokes is seeing lots of action and te eric johnson is very saints defense ranks in passing yards allowed per game over weeks for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to fantasy points allowed to passing game vs minnesota had raven fans wondering about trent again last week yards and interceptions to go with his td the usual suspects shannon and travis taylor will all be active rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last the year they rank fantasy points allowed to and allowed to bay passing game vs new york giants came up small last week with just yards and granted really cold but that hasnt seemed to bother him much in the and got most of the looks as usual te bubba franks handful thrown his way theyll face the banged giant secondary ranked in passing yards allowed per game over the last the year they rank fantasy points allowed to and allowed to orleans passing game vs san francisco brooks took a step back this week with interceptions vs td yards its not good when deuce is the but thats what happened sunday joe horn and willie jackson small this week theyll face a defense thats ranked yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the year fantasy points allowed to and fantasy points allowed passing game vs cleveland threw for yards and sunday although he did have is clearly the big play threat and shades of becoming a dominant wr ward is solid as browns rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last the year they rank fantasy points allowed to and allowed to passing game vs cincinnati continues to play well with yards and hes different when he throws the deep ball although eddie may quiet that a bit and mason both saw an of passes and both scored this week theyll face a bengal in passing yards allowed per game over the last weeks year they rank fantasy points allowed to and allowed to passing game vs arizona banks put up a whopping yards passing last week but part of the big lead washington was able to post left with an so and te caught what was thrown theyll face a cardinal defense thats been pretty good lately ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the rank fantasy points allowed to and fantasy points passing game vs st louis vick could see the start even if chandler is ok the team is at hes a dice roll if he starts but its not like consistent vick will likely spread the ball around to jefferson and brian but its tough to count on this rams rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last the year they rank fantasy points allowed to and allowed to passing game vs the week in a row couch exploited a great and lit for yards and kevin johnson was clearly the wr again this week theyll face a steeler defense that ranks yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the year fantasy points allowed to and fantasy points allowed passing game vs chicago put together another gritty day with yards and a td and jimmy smith continue to be one of the toughest wr the league theyll face a bear defense this week ranked yards allowed per game over the last weeks clearly the quite back up their rep lately for the year they rank allowed to and fantasy points allowed to so theyve allowing ff passing game vs baltimore wynn could well be an someday but today isnt that puts the cris carter randy moss owners in a bind normally theyre sure starts but now im not so certain he really looked bad at these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at so think have to look hard there plus its on monday night though the have pretty much packed it in theyll probably a good effort the ravens rank in passing yards allowed per the last weeks for the year they rank fantasy points and fantasy points allowed to york giants passing game vs green bay collins went over yards last week and that was something is still the most frequent target with and much equal attention the packers rank in passing yards game over the last weeks for the year they rank fantasy to and fantasy points allowed to york jets passing game vs oakland looked pretty old in the loss to buffalo with and and coles are decent options but this team is curtis martin especially with the oakland corners the in passing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for they rank fantasy points allowed to and fantasy to passing game vs new york jets had an excellent day with yards and although he the interceptions jerry rice and tim brown continue to play charlie garner does a nice job catching the ball the jets are in win situation and rank in passing yards allowed per game over weeks for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to fantasy points allowed to so theyve been passing game vs tampa bay started looking for receivers not named duce last better things seemed to happen he threw for and nearly james thrash saw most of the passes while te chad lewis burst the scene theyll face a defense this week ranked in allowed per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to and fantasy points allowed to bay passing game vs philadelphia johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record i think he had passing on attempts for an amazing yards per johnson is still probably a starter but thats pathetic theyll face an eagle defense thats ranked in passing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to and fantasy points allowed to passing game vs washington david boston you already know that id say plummer in lots of leagues too boston again went nuts last redskins rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to and points allowed to even with this tough boston is starter unless youre comically loaded at passing game vs miami pelt threw for under yards but the bills did get the win it me like jay is the primary target now eric moulds price are good gambles but far from sure things the in passing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for they rank fantasy points allowed to and fantasy to passing game vs dallas could miss another game which means could funny but he put together one of the bigger days among threw the ball all over the field johnnie morton and cory especially involved the cowboys rank in passing yards game over the last weeks so itll be tough for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to and fantasy points allowed to analytics inc all rights reserved
