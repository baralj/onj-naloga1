i agree with your comments about it seems like they are caught like a deer in a headlights i have bought some more shares today my view is that the company will not fold the worst case scenario is a buyout so it seems like we should bottom out shortly news on uncle i certainly called this one wrong i was absolutely convinced that the market was drastically overeating to that deal that all was above board and that could and would financially manage the matter however the stock has lost of its value in less than trading days and of its value in less than a month and yet there is total silence from management all you read are the doom and gloom wall street articles i must now believe they are true are these guys just a bunch of crooks i guess i should just take the lump as much as i hate toit may be the wise thing to do and try to salvage any said the mood is somber over there today i just cant believe my eyes why doesnt management do something lut
