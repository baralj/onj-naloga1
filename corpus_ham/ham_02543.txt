hi know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being week for many with the thursday games and the holiday im getting of rapid fire stuff that im just sending as i get it its always dash on weeks like by mark in the crack in the right forearm of washington redskins tailback davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to against the philadelphia eagles at to redskins trainer bubba yesterdays xray showed a forearm but the bone was not broken or displaced said will put a splint on the arm but will for the most part treat like a bruise davis should be able to play when he reaches a which there is not too much discomfort hurts now davis said its something i have to overcome they told day to day well see if the game were today no i couldnt im left mondays game and underwent an xray that showed no breaks said the xray taken monday was of low quality so davis yesterday davis returned to mondays game in which he rushed yards on didnt affect me at all he said we ran the ball a couple times happened and did hicks filled in for davis on monday and likely would start against if davis is unable to play veteran tailback adrian was inactive list monday but could be worked into the mix if davis or redskins can ill afford to add davis to a list of sidelined that includes wide receiver michael guard cory and quarterback brad johnson davis is the rusher with yards he is tied for the league lead rushing touchdowns and his carries place him acknowledged the injury could affect ability to hold on ball thats a concern when a running back has an arm injury hopefully they can pad it and hell be able to handle to do its much easier to not stick my neck out but here davis play against philadelphia this week if you made put a number id say he plays like normal its an enticing as have been weak against the run lately averaging yards per game over their last games no one talks about it but guy factor is likely very much at work here darrell green because the team really needed him its now being disclosed with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about leaders and such stephen davis injury appears to be primarily an issue the pain and id be very surprised to see him sit after to my friend for his help on this
