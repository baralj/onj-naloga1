are the talking points that id propose we run by stan and then have stan use with john gibson and dave use with terry spencer once everyone is ok with these ill email to stan and dave with a brief explanation that our recommendation is that we politely decline the suggestion from steve winston that we voluntarily rewrite the measurement steve suggested approach is similar to scott city measurement agreement with kinder morgan it uses as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds that structure is very different from the measurement procedures agreement which as reaffirmed by the arbitrators does not make the numbers from northerns ultrasonic meters subject to numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a btu measurement northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to aga quality specifications independent outside experts and click confirmed this fact during the can currently use or any other means it wants to determine whether to call a special test of the accuracy of northerns ultrasonic meters pursuant to section of the measurement upon calling a special test any concerns may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters has not called for a special test but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are if wants to renegotiate the measurement procedures agreement to track the structure of the scott city procedure must bring its measurement and processes within the plant up to aga quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those the current imbalance at the plant is about million owed to based on northerns meters the outstanding imbalance situation at the plant which dates to april and may of this year must be resolved irrespective of what desires to do going forward since has not called a special test of northerns meters the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months if does not agree to that reconciliation northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies
