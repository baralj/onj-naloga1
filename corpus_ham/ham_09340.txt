to answer kim andor delaine may be added to the cc on the letter the reason i mention jerry knight who works for delaine is the person that has been calling robert asking for of the adjustment thanks letter one insistence that the meters and the chromatograph were reliably and accurately doing their respective things sounds kind of defensive in fact we dont know what they were doing because we have no record of the data they sent to the roc right would it be less adversarial to simply say the ultrasonic meters continued to operate normally and to say the same for the chromatograph we do know that the meters and chromatograph did continue to operate because they had not shut down right also id like to better understand the formula were using to alibi the data what are the time periods of normal operation was that ratio developed from our data from sep if so why does the formula create such a significant increase in the variance thanks please provide any and all substantive and stylistic comments asap we have absolutely got to have the facts straight so please dont assume that anyone will catch something that you see that is in error let me know i would like to get this out this afternoon as gary folks are already inputting the adjusted that ken formulated into the system and will receive that information shortly again kudos to ken for his usual excellent job on we are missing an an in the first sentence right before the word incident that will be the letter has been set up for ken signature but let us know if it should come from someone i have the spreadsheet that ken will attach to the letter using our numbers the variance is a bit larger during the fisher roc outage period than before or after based on the plant numbers we have already been provided for that period although we dont know if those numbers are final before the outage period for the month of september so september of september the average variance was about during the outage period before kens adjustment of our numbers so part of september through part of september the average variance was still staying within the outage period after kens adjustment of our numbers per the spreadsheet that will be attached to his letter the average variance is since the fisher roc was fixed on september we have no plant numbers so we cant tell what the variance is yet i will separately email a copy of the who at should receive this letter ken mentioned a new plant named jeff knight who has provided him with figures we could always cc to other representatives maybe kim as grant suggested yesterday and i agree this letter will not prompt any agreement by in fact we expect to come back with a protest and a demand that we use for this period well keep you
