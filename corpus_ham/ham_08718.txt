john black don david w david tim christopher f foster chris h black tamara c furrow dale jim harvey presto kevin m jacoby and please forward to your groups weekday october planning afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion the administration grid steve commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time commissioners and were the most active in questioning the staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions there was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management however there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights there was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the planning process being first a provider of information to the market where are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit there was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identification of options which are not transmission related all agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge is who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution they view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met they were formed by divestiture by coops and and with a base initially their current ten year plan will add of investment their top priorities are connecting generation and load all parties not just one party the environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view the idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate projects although has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by state input needed because of the local needs and impacts be congestion management is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations west is developing a planning process which will give the the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future the needs a strong centralized planning the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources no competitor should have an advantage over another the needs a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions the decide on solutions hedging against risk the planning discussion is not about what we have now but about how to avoid future congestion the commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases the issues that need to be projects be open to is open to market based pricing for expansions the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment the debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled for expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party you are always going to have muddy issues in planning for instance if a kv line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare say a kv line should be built who pays for the extra cost in order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process appeal able to to decide such kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be the beneficiaries funding michael expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to is the best solution ie least cost planning this lead to discussion of the need for the to be provider of information to all parties can make intelligent decisions asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities the panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process worried that overbuilding distorts decisions laura felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide asked if will work in the west mark said it wouldnt laura said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage hydro facilities in michael said means an explicit cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed is looking pricing model but wont work steve said needed for real time given the nature of the northwest hydro system it must have some tweaks like and allow operator output levels to permit river coordination hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis has hydro but not as in the northwest implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load must provide information should identify solutions should be unbiased and the should be accountable the disagreement was over the last two points michael felt that unbiased was critical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance jose said and cant be unbiased since it provides services although the iso above it can be but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake this last point really comes down to a preference for iso over forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability
