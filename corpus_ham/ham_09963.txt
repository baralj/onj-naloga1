has come to my attention that changing the operational storage capacity between the evening process and the process can be unduly problematic for customers because most of the pipelines that interconnect with do not recognize the process such changes can lead to issues during the process when shipper quantities cut during the storage allocation end up being less than the calculated for the differences that result will most probably end up as shipper imbalances on this reason it is strongly recommended that operational storage capacity not be changed between the evening and the processes in the future
