i wont be available until around today in lieu of a meeting let me leave you with some comments i have no objection to the special test being conducted at the facilities in ia as far as i know they are adequate but we would want to have an expert look at them first ie and ken when a meter is removed from service at the then the plants would have to go down until that meter is tested and reinstalled i would assume that they would want to have one outage for all four meters and the total down time for the plant might be several days northern will have to restrict again during this outage there is no spare meters or spool for any of the meters if were willing to reimburse regardless of test outcome would be willing to purchase and fabricate spare meter spools in order to conduct this test with minimal impact to plant processing there would still be an outage of the plant but probably only a couple of like to get the above group together to discuss our response to letter calling for a special test the agreement requires us to cooperate with when a special test is called and there are a number of issues we will need to cooperate on including what to do for measurement while the meter is removed which outfit to use to test the meter and what the standards for testing the meter should be get a meeting set up for today if possible suspect ive inadvertently left some key people off this distribution so please route as necessary
