things all dogs need to know the garbage collector is not stealing my stuff i do not need to suddenly stand straight up when im lying under the coffee table if i roll my toys behind the fridge or behind the sofa theyre gone i can shake the rainwater out of my fur before i enter the house i should not eat the cats food either before they eat it or after they throw it up it is not necessary to find the few remaining pieces of clean carpet in the house when i am about to get sick the bathroom wastebasket is not a cookie jar i should not chew my humans toothbrush and not tell them if i chew crayons or pens especially the red ones my people will think im hemorrhaging when in the car i should not insist on having the window rolled down when its raining outside since we do not have a doorbell i dont have to bark each time i hear one on tv i should not steal my moms underwear and dance all over the backyard with it the sofa is not a face towel my head does not belong in the refrigerator i should not bite the officers hand when he reaches in for moms drivers license and car registration i should not play with dads underwear when hes on the toilet if i eat dental floss out of the bathroom garbage my people will think i have worms when they see a string hanging out of my butt i am not obligated to roll around in the dirt immediately after a bath the toilet bowl is not a water supply sticking my nose into someones crotch is not an acceptable way of saying hello the cat is not a squeaky toy so when i play with him and he makes that noise its probably not a good thing cat turds are not dog candy
