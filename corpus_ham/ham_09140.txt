power plant new york will electric industry item from energy info source new york states siting board approved plans to build a power plant in new york city clearing the way for construction to begin as early as january hopes to have the plant that at an existing oil terminal in the section of queens in the company must do a certain amount of demolition and site preparation before it can begin construction and still must receive some local permits from new york city energy is a unit of energy a privately owned energy development company based in concord area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply problems that have been identified within this region like california new york also suffers from a supply demand imbalance however even if or when power supply can be increased in new york the core load center of new still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue to take their own toll on the stability of the market in other words transmission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the extent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported the fact that energy has received approval from new york states siting board to proceed with this new york plant is significant but it should not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city government this could be easier said than done as other planned power plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the last year by community groups in new york city and surrounding boroughs who ardently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new plant problems within the new york power market have been well documented the state of new york reportedly has not brought a new plant online since when a plant opened in brooklyn it has been almost seven years since a unit in oswego ny marked the last plant to open upstate further new york expects only a increase in new capacity in the next three to four years consequently concerns about the states ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum pressure has been placed on new york regulators to expedite the approval steps for siting new plants in the state however at the same time environmental and community groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce the entire state of new york is subject to shortages the problem appears to be particularly acute in new york city a november report issued by the federal energy regulatory commission entitled investigation of bulk power markets northeast region highlighted specific capacity problems in the new york island community of million people these areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study said like northern california which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints new york city and long island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmission lines hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate new york but cannot reach the city being both densely populated and heavily residential it is difficult to site new power plants in the area consequently percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city such as the one by energy are being proposed because new york city reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times during the course of the projected shortfall is expected to increase by another mw by summer demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of new york city and new york state demand in the state rose by mw from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added demand over the course of was expected to reach mw or about percent above regulators earlier is within this market context that energy will proceed with its plans for the new power plant in new york city energy is a seeking to generate electric power with and environmentally sound technologies in the new york city area the company is a subsidiary of energy a privately owned energy development company formed in for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating facilities information obtained from energy sheds some additional light on the proposed plant as noted the unit will be a natural facility which will obtain natural gas supplied from the york facility pipeline the capital cost for the plant reportedly will be million commercial operation pending the necessary approvals on the local level is scheduled for the fourth quarter of energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant because it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the reduction of air despite this optimism the community opposition factor should not be discounted and there are several examples that may foreshadow the opposition that energy could face take sithe energies for example which hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the new york area year sithe energies originally planned a facility fueled by natural gas in ny chief among the concerns of is that the plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for cooling purposes community resistance thus became an issue for the company which altered its plans and began to consider a peaking unit also powered by natural gas that would only be operated in times of increased another example environmental and community groups won a victory in court just last week that essentially will block construction of small power plants in the south bronx brooklyn queens and long island areas each is a plant though at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than mw a coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the new york power authority claiming among other things that the state had failed to perform adequate studies the groups claim that the state should test the plants for their output of fine particulate matter a lower court had ruled in favor of the state but a judgment last week in the new york court of appeals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups the new ruling which reportedly cannot be appealed further says that the state must do unprecedented air tests at the plants or shut them down by jan a report issued earlier this year new york state electric gas corp one of new seven utilities said the state will not have enough megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until in a report issued late wednesday warned there are with new generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline infrastructure according to data included in a separate the new york iso which manages the states transmission grid between and while statewide demand in new york rose by mw generating capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by given all of these factors power supplies in new york remained strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of new generation capacity however energy which seeks to bring new generation online in new york that will be based on clean technologies may still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the construction of any new plants in the region with the exception of peaker units whose output would be closely regimented if plans for this plant are blocked or significantly altered following the experience of sithe energies the options to resolve new york supply demand imbalance will once again become focused on a combination of other approaches including conservation efforts and reliance on
