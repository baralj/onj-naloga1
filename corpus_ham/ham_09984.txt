exp gulf souths gulf pines western expansion lateral extension project federal energy regulatory commission issued several important certificates wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects including final approvals for transcontinental gas pipe lines east expansion in pennsylvania for a new pipeline by petal gas storage in mississippi and for an lateral extension to serve to mw badger power plant in wi the commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting kern river gas transmission certificates to expand its system by about million east pipe expansion project would make up for the failed phase iii portion of its expansion the east project will provide up to of transportation from pa to northeastern markets in new jersey new york and pennsylvania the expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to miles of diameter pipe and about five miles of diameter pipe mostly in western pennsylvania the project also would add hp of compression in pennsylvania and new commissions authorization is being granted based on our the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern united states thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market said in its draft order since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way the projects environmental impact will be minimized finally existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental said this summer that it expects the east facilities to be in service by november the williams subsidiary said aquila energy marketing energy co reliant energy services and williams energy marketing are all customers the incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is certificate granted to petal gas storage see related story covers a new pipeline that would extend miles to a connection with southern natural at a compressor station near enterprise ms the million project also includes a new horsepower compressor station the project is designed to deliver of gas to southern generation in the pipelines lateral extension will carry about of gas to badger generating cos proposed power plant in wisconsin the project includes miles of diameter looping along lateral and a extension of the lateral to the badger plant the project would cost million and should be in service during the summer of the kern river case shippers had requested rehearing of order granting kern authorization for its expansion project and an additional under its revised california action project shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the wheeler ridge point in southern california causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights shippers said the commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until southern california gas builds enough takeaway capacity at wheeler ridge to accommodate the additional the commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in south sees strong interest in billion southeast gulf south pipeline co lp formerly koch gateway pipeline on wednesday said the open season for the proposed billion gulf pines pipeline was extremely successful adding that response to the line from the southeast markets far exceeded the expectations the open season concluded on sept proposed mile diameter or greater natural gas pipeline which was first announced in august is expected to originate in mobile al and extend through the states of georgia south carolina and north open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation commercial residential and industrial markets in the southeastern united states said gulf south president rolf gulf pines project would interconnect with the existing gulf south pipeline near mobile bay enabling customers to access not only mobile bay supplies but also gas supplies from texas and louisiana including venice and the henry hub according to gulf south a subsidiary of lp the proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple storage facilities such as gulf souths facility in anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region said gulf south spokesman marc addition to serving power generation the company said gulf pines would extend farther east into the carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service said the project would be filed with the federal energy regulatory commission next year he added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined gulf south said the anticipated date is sometime in south currently owns and operates miles of pipeline with compressor stations and major pipeline interconnects extending from south texas through the gulf states and into the florida market files to build western frontier gas pipeline has filed an application for a new million pipeline that would extend from the cheyenne hub in northern colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern kansas and the panhandle of oklahoma the western frontier pipeline would consist of miles of diameter pipe and horsepower of compression it would transport up to of gas to markets in the addition to an interconnection with the williams central system western frontier proposes access to other major pipelines including pipeline panhandle eastern pipe line northern natural gas and natural gas pipeline company of america western frontier also would have access to the growing oklahoma intrastate markets via the williams central system the pipeline is anticipated to be in service by nov frontier pipeline is a environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific rockies supply basins to markets in the said kim senior vice president and general manager of williams central and texas gas systems we look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region which was recently cited by the us energy information administration
