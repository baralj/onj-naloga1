apple considers lucky because it was able to keep doing business that day a contingency plan according to spokeswoman lynn fox whether plan includes buying in alternative electricity or some other wouldnt say what is sure is that as silicon valley expands nations most populous state and california shows no sign of its power problem technology firms large and small are businesses that stand to suffer financially from lost production big power consumers are spending a lot of money to back up electricity sources industry observers said and in some cases may be as much of a factor as the power unreliable power costs the us economy about billion said bernie of a alto calif on power issues and technology thinks that figure lost productivity and the cost of equipment and products a power interruption could double in the next three to five of the growth of activity and electronic mills coauthor of the digital power report a trade that cost is already higher because the economy is on reliable power it is no longer just hospitals and that cant do without uninterruptible power semiconductor providers and a host of other industries cannot fulltime electricity by the end of the decade and could account for about to of the total demand said raymond james analyst frederick schultz compared in the new us economy can scarcely survive the outages and interrupted service problems that have plagued the over the past few years schultz said hot days hot economy and hot debate although the california power outage made headlines country rolling blackouts in the state are about as rare as angeles freeway indeed the state has never declared stage emergency which occurs when the statewide power below and involuntary power interruptions may begin on a rolling blackouts have been more common in the east coast and which are two areas that also are susceptible to while some industry watchers have faulted deregulation for to meet power demand in california others argue that hot robust economic growth are to blame the truth probably lies the middle a year ago weather was cooler than usual year the state has had a hot summer on june the day of the blackout the temperature in san francisco reached degrees a seen for years that spike coupled with overall growth usage pushed the power grid to its limits over a this state will need megawatts of additional energy to with the growth we are seeing now said spokesman greg with hot summer weather and new capacity still a long way off of stage emergencies california has declared is on the rise in emergency power reserves are below and many utilities begin accounts that have identified themselves as and ask them to reduce their usage by set amounts interruptible customers are typically commercial and by early august the california independent system operator nine stage alerts said patrick a spokesman for agency that manages most of the electricity flow around the with one in and four in during a stage customers agree to cut their consumption when asked for lower electricity rates and often help to stave off the need to more serious measures such as rolling blackouts however it a sword for the commercial customer which can face if it fails to comply with the order penalties can offset the company stands to gain from the program and thats even for the cost of lost productivity aerospace and defense co ba and technology distributor ingram micro inc im are operating facilities in california under the program during the first week of august each was called upon its power consumption both companies see the program as a way to good members of the community while saving money the manufacturing rocket takes two to three years said walt rice a spokesman at beach calif facility the impact of a stage is fairly outweighed by the cost savings he said we live state where there is a high demand for electricity we are doing things even a small amount of that demand said paul la senior of worldwide facilities for ingram micro still admitted compliance isnt without inconvenience companies need closely with utilities to determine the number of power can tolerate said but that determination can be make for example while a semiconductor plant operator knows a can destroy a days production and prepares for this event of a commercial bakery may be unprepared for the disruption can have on the embedded in its machinery digital mills said companies such as silicon graphics inc communications international inc are spending more money either to back up replace or supplement the electricity the power grid than the entire electric industry is spending by of at least five possibly said mills the stakes are too you are a or a fab maker he said other for that reason companies are trying to be about usage earlier this year oracle corp considered going off grid entirely by building its own power generation facility for the redwood shores calif software company further details of the plans progress this option may but its one reason why the makers of power turbines are faced order backlogs and its also driving demand for supplies such as those manufactured by companies like co and for new power technologies such as fuel and some of which are still years away viability others like silicon energy co are to allow utilities and their customers to better manage consumption silicons software allow its users to track electricity consumption with this in mind mills suggests real financial impact of power interruptions isnt the money on these events but the value of what companies
