fantasy sports publications are putting it on and i gotta say i think its going to youre interested in competing in the world championship of i wanted to give you an early for this talked to emil at fantasy sports publications and theyve over applications for the slots so dont wait too ill see you in las our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle for the stretch run heres how i see the rushing game i rank players and to determine who to start i always asking me how i can have a guy ranked highly on the under a that favors the defense just because one be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean id player with the best green may have a horrible week but unless youre sitting on ricky williams or marshall your guy no matter who hes lining up against yes even weeks performance the info is meant to be just one more your box when it comes to deciding between are provided by mike halls excellent league management are from target numbers are from our get to stacey mack vs minnesota mack played well last week rushing for yards on carries hes settling into the starting role pretty well still on the fred taylor front so you have to assume macks going to job with no playoff hopes it probably makes sense not to rush mack will face an ultra soft viking defense this week ranked inrushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to york jets curtis martin vs indianapolis martin ran hard last week he had yards on carries he caught a couple of passes this might be his week though as are weak on defense ranking in rushing yards allowed per the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy to if hes going to explode this is the louis marshall vs carolina end of story hes the best player in fantasy it matters and it doesnt the panthers rank in rushing per game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed knee was described as puffy after the game but he be fine and play although some are saying will time hes still a must start in my opinion eddie george skip hicks vs oakland one hurts eddie george owners have been circling on their oakland game with their porous rush defense and then skip hicks last week and looks like earl campbell rushing for yards on and a score granted those numbers are padded with a rush george is such a team player that he reportedly didnt staying in the game as he had the hot hand i think back this week in his regular role but hicks could get the call time the raiders have improved on defense now they just rank rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to the maurice smith bob christian vs buffalo looked a little better or healthier this week but hes he rushed times for yards sunday is clearly going to be more involved at he had rushes yards and a score christian also tacked on at this point id say christian deserves a look in the bill defense is pretty weak ranking in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to anthony thomas vs washington carries last week for yards i think its safe to is back hes a perfect fit for this conservative offense bears defense looks like itll keep them in most games which involved hell face a redskin defense that ranks in allowed per game over the last weeks and in fantasy to bays green vs cleveland my opinion that green owners should just forget about last was held to just yards on carries by a surging tennessee see very little to make me think this wasnt an aberration this face a softer brown defense thats ranked in rushing per game over the last four weeks for the year cleveland in fantasy points allowed to fantasy football have memories that last about days i personally am last weeks performance wipe out what has been a great dominic rhodes vs new york jets too early to be talking about james being a product of but the truth of the matter is that no name dominic rhodes it up lately hes had rushing yards over the last he rolled for of them on carries and his was yards so its not like he padded the stats with a yarder passes to boot clearly hes playing at a high level right is a must start in most leagues the jets were horrible early the run but have now improved to average ranking in allowed per game over the last weeks for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to smith vs miami know smith had fun against his old team sunday when he yards on carries he continues to be one of the of over the last weeks he ranks as the in per game smith should have had a td but went down at the hell face a dolphin defense thats been soft lately they rank rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to orleans ricky williams deuce vs tampa bay had a sub par game monday night and it does seem like coach has been looking the other way the last few games he only had monday he did gain yards so he did well when he there some of that can be attributed to the rams and their williams out although you cant ignore deuce had catches for yards but just one carry the special lately ranking in rushing yards allowed per game last weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points keep an eye on warren who missed a good bit of week with a shoulder injury itd be a nice boost if hes less york giants tiki barber ron vs seattle continues to steal the show from ron barber rushed yards only had carries for yards barber the giants leading receiver with receptions i dont see a lot seattle is ranked in rushing yards allowed per the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy to garrison hearst vs philadelphia hearst continues to be one of the best stories in the league for yards on carries sunday you have to be a about him though as kevan barlow got both rushing and jackson and fred saw red zone carries hearst will be a runs up and down the field but it looks like coach steve faith in the other guys for the the eagles rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to michael thomas jones vs dallas are looking pretty bad for michael owners as we the carries allotted to jones have been creeping up last looked more like a full blown time share with running yards and jones totaling yards on carries neither are any good but thats bad news for owners more concern is the fact that jones is looking like the short yardage red zone guy the cowboys rank in rushing yards allowed per game last weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points its tough right now to put much faith in either guy though the favorable shawn vs atlanta henrys tough rookie year continued sunday as he injured his will likely get the bulk of the work this week much sunday running times for yards he did catch hell likely be better with a week of practice with the the falcons havent been anything special against the run in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed to for the smith vs arizona smith looked like the old smith old as in means not very good he struggled to get yards on carries and generally wasnt a factor hes an up and down player so taking a chance with him the cardinals arent much on in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to smith vs new england smith is a grinder type back that needs lots of carries to he only rushed times sunday for yards get it done travis minor is a threat but it looks to me like will stay with smith for now new england ranks in allowed per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to chris jerome amos had a pretty good game against baltimore with yards on but he hurt his shoulder and is now questionable weeks game ran hard but had little room to yards on carries and finally jerome is mix although the early word has him as doubtful again for this obviously theyre being very careful to preserve him for well try to stay on this story this week for you the surprisingly tough against the run lately ranking in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to vs kansas city struggled a bit last week with just yards on carries he did add yards on catches hell face an improved kc week ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to alexander vs new york giants been an up and down last couple of weeks for alexander owners but broken ankle alexander is back in the saddle as the for him to pick up where he left off last week he rushed for on carries plus a td the giants have been lately in stopping the run ranking in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to stephen davis vs chicago davis played well last week with yards on carries was one of the few bright spots for washington this week he faces but beatable bear defense that ranks in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to the moe williams terry allen vs cincinnati know its not good when leads the team in and elvis leads the team in rushing but thats sunday against the steelers i wonder if ray lewis thinks have a real defense yet moe williams logged yards on and terry allen made a less than smashing debut with on carries you do the math tough to say how itll be split but youd have to think allen will see more time the bengals good as but theyre very good ranking in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to tough especially since its not how the carries will be james jackson white vs green bay this one closely this week as jackson tweaked his troublesome he could be ok but its not clear early this week if he id expect see white over ben gay as gay has made more share of mistakes whoever runs will be facing the suddenly who rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to priest holmes tony richardson vs san diego had holmes ranked last week im guessing see more our lead and raise him up the charts as well he had a monster with yards on carries plus the score hes a against pretty much any defense this week hell face a san ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to i wouldnt let that stop me do keep an eye on his health as hes nursing a sore groin that might limit michael vs jacksonville of indianapolis i dont know that theres been a more minnesota or one tougher to predict each week you get fired up and then he cools off last week he was back to his workload with only carries he did gain yards he ran he did fine with him its a numbers game give him and eventually hell break one but opportunities wont do hell face a very tough jacksonville defense thats been hot rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to charlie garner vs tennessee garner had his usual productive day with yards rushing on plus another yards receiving the big news was not getting a carry looks like zack is back in at although that can change at any moment the titans shut green last week so thats a worry they rank in rushing per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank points allowed to duce vs san francisco continues to salvage his rushing numbers with his contributions passing game he rushed times for yards sunday had fumbles but on the bright side he caught passes for theyll find the going a little tougher this week against ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to bays mike vs new orleans go crazy trying to figure out which one of these guys will week to week only had carries for yards only managed rushes for yards was in the tampa dink and dunk passing game but thats tough to theyll face a new orleans defense thats likely smarting from defeat they rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to for the richard huntley vs st louis should be rested after the bye week unfortunately rest him any more talented the rams rank in rushing yards game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed to sothis isnt looking corey vs baltimore strength against strength this week with facing the ravens can imagine it the bengals will be hurting without smith at means is the whole offense and you can bet the ravens will up for it on a forward looking note it doesnt get any easier as he has tennessee and on the horizon if your hasnt passed id consider dealing him the ravens rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks but i think than that they rank for the year in fantasy points allowed james stewart vs hip injury may not be as bad as feared he had a in their first victory last week rushing for yards on the awful news this week is that hes playing are dominating offenses right now ranking in rushing per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank points allowed to do it for the rushing passing to analytics inc all rights reserved
