game heres how i see the this week exactly where i rank players and to determine who to start just one may be more favorable than another that mean id start the player with the best the is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to eddie george vs brown defense assuming eddie george can injured toe healthy and i think he can he could have a monster a brown defense been terrible against the rush for they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing and in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks will likely be fired up after a stinging loss at home to the i expect george to take out some frustrations on the smith vs jets defense have to look awfully hard a hotter than smith in their he ran for and yards at the time it seemed like a fluke but smith almost that pace since then jay and the passing just enough threat to keep the defenses semi honest and smith rest over the last four weeks the jets rank in rushing per york ron tiki barber vs lion defense as you know the giants running game is governed by how close they keep the jim abandons the ground game especially ron the giants start to trail against a less than explosive lions giants ought to be able to keep this very close if not lead most of been weak defending the run over the last four weeks rank in rushing yards allowed per game james vs packer defense green allowing rushing per game over the last four week which ranks them continue to roll this week against a packer defense missing williams out with a knee injury de holiday may be but he looks like play and some concern but i for james to lewis vs cowboy defense the cowboys gave up their rushing days to quick slasher charlie garner and duce but guessing power running lewis almost as quick as those be a great play against dallas for the season dallas ranks points allowed to the opposing look for him to catch the of the backfield as fletcher vs bronco defense last four week denver ranks in rushing yards allowed per game smells a lot like the denver bengal game to me winless into town with a big power back and nothing to lose we all record setting day and many remember rushing in the last game of against the broncos working his way into the mix and really muddying the eye on this one and if it looks like one of these guys will garner of the carries he could be worth a flyer stanley vs cardinal defense defense remains pretty weak against the rush they rank yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the year in fantasy points allowed to the opposing the trick which eagle will get the carries i like bigger and can bull doze his way through the cards been down as i believe supposed to have the acting career not the other way michael vs eagle defense watch this one closely is struggling to get healthy with bruised ribs if he can go the this week philadelphia ranks in rushing per game over the last four weeks stronger over the they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing is in worse shape with pneumonia so has incentive to get sammy morris shawn vs chief defense morris battling ankle and looks to be a game time decision is plenty capable go the chiefs are an attractive as they rank yards allowed per game over the last four weeks they rank points allowed to the opposing for the year watch this to see if the bills offer hints to go green vs colt defense with out will be asked to carry the load the colts are vulnerable to the in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks can play be a nice boost for green as the defense able to key on stopping the ground corey vs patriot defense how much would you rely mitchell if you were dick me neither whether or scott mitchell under center still the corey show has shown itself to vulnerable against the rush ranking yards allowed per game over the last four weeks knows to carry the team and do his best his success will depend effect mitchell can be in drawing the attention toward charlie garner vs falcon defense charlie garner his great season against a falcon team playing better rush than it had been for the year atlanta ranks in allowed to the opposing but over the last four weeks they rate in rushing yards allowed per game if without wr garner will be asked to carry a little more of the load something gladly done all jerome vs jaguar defense with the wr shuffling in i think is really the only steeler worthy in most leagues a solid performer though that should good day grinding the ball out jacksonville ranks over four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game for the year they in fantasy points allowed to the opposing be power the steeler just line up and try to run over the jr kevin vs bengal defense the bengals to predict for the last four weeks they rank in rushing per game and for the year they come in at in fantasy to the opposing but they absolutely shut down week i look for and to have moderate success improving unit is questionable with ribs so keep an eye james allen vs buccaneer defense as with the pass bay is good but not quite as dominant as their reputation for four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game per game for the year they rate in fantasy points allowed to so not like invincible with shane and scaring no one though it could be a long stephen davis vs ram defense as is so often the case the could be forced to abandon their running game if the rams jump washington would dearly love to establish stephen davis on but they may not be able to if forced to play catchup rate over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per the year they check in at in fantasy points allowed to even with bud carson helping coach the defense they can anderson vs defense anderson continues to make improvement and he seems close to his form to me defense that can definitely be run on over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to the opposing not unlike the situation with the running success largely hinges on the ability of the to hang tough anderson can be taken out of the game if the hold jeff and company down in the passing robert smith vs panther defense said for years love robert smith play a full season and now seeing that could having a great year and i think continue to have carolina been pretty strong lately against the in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing the vikings can control steve no small feat chances fred taylor vs steeler defense fred taylor is beginning his way out most fantasy dog house as he continues to be a on a team without many bright spots been running hard but be a real gut check for him as he squares off against a very rush defense only allowed over the last four games ranks for the year in fantasy points allowed to the and taylor will have his hands vs viking defense questionable with a bad toe and the panthers sound about him playing sunday keep an eye on it as he was able through the pain last week although it seems to be worse this week last if he go see undrafted rookie fb brad hoover start ask me how that happens minnesota is decent against ranking over the last four games in rushing yards allowed per for the year in fantasy points allowed to the opposing mike vs bear defense most myself thought new offensive coordinator les would more in frank type roles happened yet but be interesting to see if they start getting the big guy the balls ways sure his fumbling problems are still a huge course not something a guy like tony dungy talks very the bears are decent against the run ranking over the last in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year they check in in fantasy points allowed to the opposing davis vs charger defense davis scared everyone it was reported he had a problem with his calf he says and was calling it just below the knee need as healthy as possible this week as the chargers have been playing defense of late ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over four weeks for the year still ranked in fantasy points to the opposing reflecting some of their earlier struggles desperately need davis to shoulder the load with brian be interesting to see how he responds a tough bet he does justin watson vs redskin defense the good news for watson he have to worry about the bad news is saw a good bit of work at tailback this week and marshall making noise about playing monday did practice some coach mike still remains pessimistic about him seeing much week keep an eye on it as sure be a top story but he look to be a big factor the redskin rush defense is over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game for the year in fantasy points allowed to the opposing travis prentice white vs titan defense the tennessee at an awful time as the titans are coming off a at home to baltimore and will likely be looking to vent this week cleveland looks to bear the brunt of prentice and white have been unexceptional lately and i them improving against a tough titan defense over the last four tennessee ranks in rushing yards allowed per game they also for the year in fantasy points allowed to the opposing these do in a pinch on other weeks but i see it this james stewart vs giant defense stewart is still a starter leagues but i like his here although you the time he ran wild on tampa bay with an awful too rank for the year in fantasy points allowed to the opposing the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per strong having a healthy jason back will help the as it allows more safety help to commit to the napoleon vs saints defense keep an eye on it but point tyrone is looking very questionable with not one but ankle sprains his most recent sprain is thought to be worse than sprain on the other ankle that was limiting him already a bit as the sole and saints are killers for the year in fantasy points allowed to the opposing and over the last they check in at in rushing yards allowed per game one ray for oakland is that dt norman hand is questionable with bone chips ankle although they believe he can play even though he committee vs bills defense by now you probably than to risk starting any wearing a chief uniform this week to follow that rule as the bills are playing excellent they rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed game and the rate for the year in fantasy points allowed to the i shy away from chief against any team but especially this tough if you have any choice anders will but expect to see plenty of tony richardson and frank in particular does a nice job receiving the down by cincinnati last week and the ravens are a just a tad than the bengals when it comes to run defense if anyone can smith but last sunday was very worrisome the ravens are after a huge road win at tennessee still a solid but have his hands more than full sunday the ravens rank in allowed per game over the last four weeks and for the year they in fantasy points allowed to the opposing york curtis martin vs dolphin defense i see a repeat week meltdown from miami on defense martin will have a tough of him against the dolphin defense that ranks over the last in rushing yards allowed per game over the season they rank fantasy points allowed to the opposing the dolphins were hopeful thomas could return but not looking too likely now tougher for martin if he orleans jerald moore chad morton vs raider defense new a tough break as the new are forced to make their first the rush defense in rushing yards allowed per game over the weeks for the year not quite as tough ranking points allowed to the opposing tough to call right now carries will be distributed as the saints are understandably lipped i expect moore to carry most of the load to begin with the more physical back and much more like williams than is morton closer to the scat back down guy mold i can envision to the rotation new england is using with jr and for ff purposes of course like to see one guy take over but see that now the other wild card is newly signed terry allen excited about football again see how quickly he can get
