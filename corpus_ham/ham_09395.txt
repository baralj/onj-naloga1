how we have our pools set up should help us or hurt us yes depending upon how you set up your pool transactions it will make a difference on how you may be scheduled in order to maintain the highest possibility that one would not get allocated through a pool from a receipt location we do inform our customers that the take away shipper should be firm and should not be receiving any gas from any one else on the transaction the more daisy chain transactions at a pool the less reliable the gas becomes during an allocation of course the highest reliability is not go through a pool at all and go from point to fits into the picture and if this is going to cause unsure about this gets allocated are big contract gets frozen so we can not nominations not sure what he means by big contract get frozen but any time an allocation occurs the shipper always has the ability to make nomination changes the risk is that any changes that one may do could affect the outcome of the allocation from the previous allocation we do recommend that our customers do not make any changes at a point of allocation unless it is necessary can not guarantee they will not be effected it all depends upon what any one else within the chain is also doing the shipper can make changes to either their quantity or ranks without being considered a new nomination line this is the case should we release our contract to ourselves in the so we would then have two contracts which would allow us to not have problem as described above unsure about this the amount of capacity to and through by line example that includes all the cycles unsure about this you have an allocation after the timely cycle priority going to from the field if we have our nominations in and do not change them should be primary if you have primary rights dependent upon k rights to would happen if we were on time and got all of our gas confirmed and then one of our customers changes their nomination in our pool there is potential that your customer could affect you at once again it depends upon what his other transaction are at the point he can make a mistake that could affect you we cannot guarantee what his does
