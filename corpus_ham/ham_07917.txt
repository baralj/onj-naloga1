what did you think of the debate i thought all in all bush did a good himself gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage do you the american public notices that the only issue he makes is with cuts going to the wealthiest one percent that is the biggest load i have ever heard i know bush cant say this but if you do the wealthiest pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately rest of the country so if there is an across the board tax the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back
