hi how i see the rushing game this soon for exactly where i rank players and to determine who to always receive asking me how i can have a guy ranked highly on but listed under a that favors the defense one may be more favorable than another that mean id start the player with the best have a horrible one week but unless youre sitting on or marshall greens your guy no matter who hes lining the info is meant to be just one more tool in your it comes to deciding between are provided by mike halls excellent league management are from get to moe williams vs indianapolis jason unfortunate injury moe williams is handed the a lifetime a month ago he was stuck behind terry allen and hes likely the guy wholl be asked to carry the rushing load for world champs id expect see fb a larger role williams had already started becoming a much of the passing game catching passes for yards last week he carries for yards i think hell do fine the reeling their defense ranks in rushing yards allowed per the last weeks and for the year they rank in fantasy to you saw how garrison heart ran wild on them last bays green vs jacksonville green he rolled for yards on carries last week as solid as ever is ranked in rushing per game over the last weeks as if you needed another reason orleans ricky williams vs carolina williams struggled a bit last week but still finished with yards carries and a td he also added yards on simply too good to sit the panthers rank in rushing per game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed start jerome vs minnesota faced a tough titan team last week and still rumbled for yards carries stewart is somewhat of a worry will get his share the steelers losing ol marvel smith for of time with a knee injury could be a problem on the plus steelers are for real and they know is their key this face a much softer viking defense that ranks in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to vs seattle was the intended target of an amazing passes even more impressive is that he caught all passes and netted receiving paired with yards rushing on carries a very quiet yards of offense on the downside he did fumble failed to get into the his involvement in the offense great to see hell face a seattle defense this week ranked inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and in allowed to theyll also be without suspended cb shawn yielded yards rushing last week against kansas garrison hearst vs buffalo hearst literally seemed to have turned back the clock last was the first time ive been able to say that truly looks like hearst his burst and his cutbacks were exceptional throw in that kevan barlow injured his shoulder and im liking him even an eye on terry jackson and fred to see what role the them with barlow out i wouldnt be surprised to see them get short yardage chances theyll face the that ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to louis marshall vs atlanta cant bench marshall especially against in rushing yards allowed per game over the last the michael vs oakland clocked in last week with another of his middle of the yards on carries but he did get the i wish hed be more productive in the passing game as needs another option besides david boston this week he faces defense ranked a surprising in rushing yards allowed per the last weeks i caught some grief last week from people with me suggesting tiki barber could have a good game we know how that turned out the raiders are a very good great team but people run the ball on them theyre a little tougher points allowed to where they rank richard huntley vs new orleans huntley came up small again last week with several stuffs at he had carries for yards in an ugly saving grace may be that brad hoover or any of the other arent any better this week hell face a saints defense that soft lately ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed still its hard to get too excited about a panther at this anthony thomas james allen vs detroit allen got the start for the ailing anthony thomas and rambled for yards on carries it may have been track in minnesota but allen looked much quicker than i ever him this creates a huge headache for allen thomas dick would never say it but the bears obviously have a to go deep into the playoffs they know they need a healthy i would think youd see very cautious about using a weak detroit team yes anything can happen just ask but i would think see the bears lean on allen one more is pure speculation on my part as its still very early in the tuned detroit ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over four weeks and in fantasy points allowed to smith vs new york jets smith continues to amaze he rolled up yards on last week with a td his longest run was yards so its he padded those numbers with one huge play the jets rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks as theyve from early on they rank in fantasy points allowed to charlie garner zack vs arizona looked like his typical self sunday slashing for yards on he also caught passes for yards including a trouble is that he often has to watch zack score the short the sidelines hard to believe coach jon could be to you garner owners but thats how it is the cardinals rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks but for rank in fantasy points allowed to garner is too sit for most eddie george vs cleveland some reason the titans feel the need to throw on every down only had carries last week he did gain yards needs more work the browns are rejuvenated but theyve been run as they rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to stephen davis vs dallas left the game last week with back spasms long enough for to steal what should have been davis td ouch hed been on leaving davis returned to the game and looks to be ok for dallas has been sliding down the defense ranking and now comes in at in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for they still rank in fantasy points allowed to travis henry vs san francisco when we were ready to write travis henry off he produces like expecting him to do all along against a very good miami rolled for yards on carries and a td new pelt is clearly softening the defense as they now must respect game san francisco is nothing special on defense ranking inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the in fantasy points allowed to they allowed yards colts last priest holmes tony richardson vs philadelphia holmes and richardson are valuable fantasy players richardson is areal live featured with yards on carries he threw yards on receptions to boot richardson doesnt get but he has a nose for he rushed times for yards sunday and scored again the eagle defense looked very the redskin rushing game last week they rank in allowed per game over the last weeks and in fantasy to york jets curtis martin vs new england martins ready to roll after a bye week as the jets face tough with new england the patriots rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and in allowed to duce vs kansas city seems to be running hard but his eagles are in a funk he rushed for yards and caught passes for yards sunday team is sliding while kansas city is getting stronger the in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for though they rank in fantasy points allowed to so you have might be able to do alexander vs san diego alexander had us worried last week as he struggled on the ground yards on carries he made up for it on the receptions caught balls for yards and a score hes looking more like plus with each game the chargers rank in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank a in fantasy points allowed to last week they did a good arizona holding them to rushing bays mike vs cincinnati of these guys turned in nice days against st louis monday times for yards and a score carried times for yards and scores both were factors passing game as well id look for something similar against this week cincinnati is falling back to reality and rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the year in fantasy points allowed to is obviously in td only leagues but i can see going with either of the maurice smith bob christian vs st louis smith injured his ankle last week and turned the reins over to and christian responded in a huge way dan reeves is smoke and mirrors here but i wouldnt be surprised to see a big part of this offense even if smith can go as you saw with mike the rams are certainly vulnerable to a big and christian fills that bill st louis ranks in rushing per game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed the rams are beat up though and christian might be worth a shot ready to roll the dice just understand the risk though that go back to his old role if smith is corey vs tampa bay said all along that this could be a very good team if they could adequate play from the evidently thats too much to ask passing game quickly fading is having a very tough time room to run managed yards on carries last a good cleveland team the going wont be any easier this tampa bay that ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed you never know which will show and its tough to figure buccaneer team will be there that makes this a tough call all james jackson ben gay vs tennessee jackson tweaked his foot again so watch to see how this shakes gay did see action sunday jackson was a non factor with yards carries fortunately for him gay was even worse with carries this week theyll both face a tough titan ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the last the season theyre ranked in fantasy points allowed to mike anderson davis vs miami anderson answered the critics well with a carry day for sunday he also scored a td with gary out for its now down to anderson and davis watch this one as davis is reportedly making good progress and could play if hes ready to go i think see mike give of carries some are even saying he might start i itll be anderson starting with davis seeing a fair amount of an eye on this through the week miami ranks in rushing per game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed but they were exposed by buffalos travis henry last dominic rhodes vs baltimore love to see a no name like dominic rhodes come in and succeed he active last week and is doing a great job of filling in james he rushed times for yards and had receptions for yards hell face a tough defense this baltimore though the ravens rank in rushing yards allowed over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed to unless you have very solid options id take a hard look at in your stacey mack vs green bay mack isnt making anyone forget about fred taylor but mack owners like his last week he put up yards on carries status is still up in the air so id think probably see the packers bring a tough defense ranked in rushing per game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed so its going to be rough going for him although it wont be as it was last week against the ravens on a side note i keep that taylor could be done for the season nothing official jaguars though you truly never know with fred taylor i could missing the rest of the games and i could also see him stepping in and lighting up the smith travis minor vs denver again smith looked tentative and slow he only gained carries although he did score travis minor on the looked explosive and gained yards on carries the miami won the game probably keeps smith in the slot but you have how minor would do with a bigger role had to shuffle line due to injuries something it did not have to do last is ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the last this wont be a cakewalk they rank in fantasy points allowed for the smith troy vs washington sad to see but smith is probably not the best on the especially not from a fantasy football angle troy put up yards on carries sunday but he did score on the other hand managed just yards on carries you do your here clearly there are ill feelings between smith and hes publicly questioning their desire to win as they evaluate talent year im sure hes a little more sensitive as the primary seem to be evaluating is the guy wholl take his job this week face a rejuvenated redskin team and a tough defense they rank rushing yards allowed per game over the last james stewart vs chicago stewart roared back with a vengeance last thursday rolling up on carries he looked strong and quick was still in the picture with rushes for yards receptions for yards both should have trouble though this an excellent bears team ranked in rushing yards allowed per the last weeks for the year they rank in fantasy to michael vs is slowly climbing his way out of the super bust spotlight have randy moss on the field at the same time to deflect he rushed times for yards and flashes hes a threat anytime he touches the ball he a pass this week he faces a very tough defense with the steelers rank in rushing yards allowed per game over weeks and in fantasy points allowed to so you have to as a tough do it for the rushing passing to analytics inc all rights
