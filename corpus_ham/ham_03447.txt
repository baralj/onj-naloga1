rookie anthony thomas who has emerged as the chicago bears top this season may miss sundays central clash against the who has rushing yards and four touchdowns has been doubtful for sundays game with a strained right allen a rusher last season who lost his job to would start if thomas is inactive for sundays is a crucial game for both teams the bears need the victory ahead of the packers in the central and the vikings need the to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot our view its a dice roll here folks he hasnt practiced all week and james been working with the first team if you dont have anyone close ability you might roll the dice with him but if youve got id probably go with the safer route from coach dick im guessing he sees allen as not a horrible choice plus the fact to get allen healthy for the stretch run and playoffs just my analytics inc all rights reserved
