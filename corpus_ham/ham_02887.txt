back was a helluva lot better than i thought it would be a month long and though at times more boring then anything i have in my entire life i still got to get attacked by an helicopter soviet suicide squads with backpacks stuffed weapons and explosives that charge your tactical operations then detonate it went like soon as we got there we started for a combined attack live fire exercise basically what this came down to had and howitzers and mortars with more ammo then ever see in an excercise tow platoon and a dismounted platoon our job was to assault bunker complex to set up a support by fire in order the main efforts assault on the battalions bn main what this boils down to is smash a path from start point to smash bunker complex continue smashing path to once smash put of steel on the bn main obj minutes to allow a notional bn main effort to get up to the to say it was awesome i will never see that many assets that much steel unless some bad guy screws up really really and we go do it for real after experiencing this there is no high holy hell i would ever want to be anywhere near the end it was my first act out of with my company and the oc thought i did well enough to warrant a division far as the actual rotation went it was pretty boring compared to fire it was four phases entry into the box seizing intensity conflict attack mout stuff only exciting stuff came in phases and when we actually had was especially cool cause me and my guys were so much death and pain to enemy dismounts attempting to obstacles in order to pass their main effort of armored vehicles and that the little bastards backed up reconsolidated again by this time our defending the obstacle was wiped guess what my forward observer wasnt with the platoon but was in an to the obstacle the bad guys smashed the platoons and was safe to try again on the obstacle we called a mass the obstacle rounds of and needless to say they hell there in a hurry but not without leaving a couple of hulls and a mound dead dismounts as a result of destroying effort we turned them back into the brigades main engagement the armor guys slugged it out with them for was fun if you like ur people any deployment will be was nice a welcome change to this island stuff plus looked just like home in fact it was and a half hours away deer camp bill i was tempted to just pack it up and take off just wait fer opening this concludes my post brief any information about yourself create your own public profile at
