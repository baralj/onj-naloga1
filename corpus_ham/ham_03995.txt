scouts general managers and player personnel directors are on impressions made at private workouts and the chicago june because so many players are relatively close in terms and opinions could change almost daily this is the first of well have on number of players still have work to do to earn spots easily sneak back on with impressive workouts andor a strong borderline who didnt make list but have to move up are sophomore forward rush senior smith temple junior guard mark freshman guard senior forward brian cardinal connecticut junior point indiana senior guard ohio state senior northern arizona senior center dan ohio guard michael redd state senior center and nigerian forward of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the the problem for underclassmen such as and is they if its worth the risk to stay in the draft underclassmen have to pull their name out and still return to school rush have all said they plan on staying in the draft regardless of checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its and came up with these selections for the week of may towered over much of the competition in go with or martin but the pick here is the either hold on to the pick and see if williams plays or deal it to the bulls for the no and no a steal by grabbing martin at no hes the the draft and with a healthy leg the most effective could play next to shareef and reeves if arent ready to go with martin he makes for a tantalizing inquired about swift and see him as a potential goes against coach john philosophy of how to use but if swift knows hes going to the clips he could opt to school he has said he will not hire an agent leaving the for a their triangle offense if they cant trade for is line he needs work but he has the skills to develop into a product than luc was during the bulls championship wont let drop below no if hes available gives the inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked doc rivers will fall in love with his work for a month and wont let him slide past them miles might be a but millers versatility will win the hawks over at no a small forward over a big miles and to the nets or keep two players who could players in the league miles might have more of an upside than tim floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and the patience to wait for miles to center in the draft is the covet him cleveland might not give them the chance because of the need with the uncertainty in their frontcourt reviews on either scouts love him or think hes too but not above six the rockets need scorers and alexander will individual workouts the choice of alexander johnson or morris is hard to argue alexander can rise defense for a jump shot and has a pro magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of picks if miles is gone will be too by no orlando him for months and rivers can afford to let mature pressured to play him next with his skills on the wing the need size let a scorer get past them in the draft johnson learned defense good and bob so rick pressure defense shouldnt be will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft but need athleticism in the frontcourt they cant afford to go with or a slower big man fits here if he does well in in chicago if he a point guard with one of their three picks but no one is good spend the no or no pick on cleaves is at the top of list list and would fit rivers style of play and of his leadership and the local hero leave the state gives them a scorer to go or in place of grant hill if he leaves via free agency could if hes gone the pistons will take alexander or and thomas is fourth on their list behind martin and will be available by the time they pick thomas can give them and defender something they lacked in their playoff losses to point to jason williams could come in and wouldnt be pressure to perform immediately hes the no point guard would have probably been in the lottery next season but he doesnt of the teams needs above which is why he falls all the way to he gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to lewis if he a point guard but wont take one at no has the upside of the senior points dont carry into the draft but the potential a draft pick may scare into returning to the late lottery maybe to dallas but if he falls the hornets him can play power forward or center for the hornets because ability to block shots and score from feet in to the basket could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this called on behalf and love him as a combo guard to come bench would likely stay in the draft if hes in the regardless of where hes being begun working out point guards and have in their top five and are all gone is the for the for taking frederic last year jeff van gundy wants tough gets the nod over jason collier if the go proved this season that he can play with passion in the from nearby utah he can score from the wing but hell playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a if doesnt go to the jazz he could slip out of the in this draft but cant go after one in the lottery the point guard left could be he can play both hes one of the better defenders in the draft and would give some versatility on the guy to go with luc either as a backup or on the collier has more offensive potential than many big men the the luxury to allow collier a few years to develop into a fresh legs either with or oklahoma states will probably get the nod because of his duke pedigree he go higher but his status fits more as a late for his work ethic in workouts and he didnt leave school some sort of assurance he could go in the first round the a history of going younger in the need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player from the fledgling to the has the size and potential to be an center doesnt have left in his any one of the bubble players could go such as rush but mason is a more polished experienced player he gives an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their is a senior writer at draft list for draft has some candidates for internet ventures terms of use and privacy policy information are
