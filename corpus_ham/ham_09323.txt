just got done reviewing some of the data in the october invoice for and i can see some major problems it looks to me like about of the gates have daily estimated usage during the last half of the month which caused us to incur numerous penalties which i dont believe are correct in both zone and zone dit was obvious that the data was estimated because the flow is almost exactly the same every day for the last two weeks of the month i suspect it only varies a little due to the btu factor we were getting penalties on the warm days in the second half of the month because you are overestimating the load on those days some of the larger gates to look at include iowa mt alto but there are many need to look at this more a lot more including other months but before i waste more of my time id like to know how and why these were estimated and if you are already working on a correction this is the kind of thing that makes in very difficult for us because we have to rely on your billing data which only is available two weeks after a month ends and that isnt even very good the way you are doing it i dont even understand how you can bill us for now on i think id like to get a statement each month of all the estimated data when we get the bill so we know what to look
