controller at the company were thrilled as the stock rose to about a share in late from in adjusted for by the late the couple felt overexposed to dell in addition to the dell stock that the company had contributed to their plans they had received stock options as bonuses and they had bought a home in austin texas where the realestate market is tied in part to the fortunes of dell one of the areas biggest greens sold some of the stock they received as bonuses but dell wouldnt let employees sell shares the company contributed to their retirement accounts until they had been at the company for five years i tried so hard to sell mr green says we went around and company changed its policy last year to allow all dell employees to sell the shares in their plan and shift the proceeds into alternatives available through the plan by then though dell shares had plummeted erasing from the greens accounts thats as much as we paid for our house mr green says both left dell earlier this year for other spokesman tr reid declines to comment on the greens circumstances he says that any employees who lose so much money on company contributions could do so only because they had made a bundle until that point and providing dell shares to the employee plan he says certainly provides incentive to not only think but act like a company ended the rule mr reid says because it was no longer necessary to keep employees focused on improving dells shareholder value and he says dell executives dont have to hold company stock in their supplementary plan because they receive a significant portion of their compensation in dell stock and thus they already have the broader interests of the company and shareholders squarely in their filings show that dell executives nonetheless have means to protect themselves from exposure to the stock michael dell chairman and chief executive of the computer company he founded transferred a total of million shares worth million into exchange funds in

mr dells hedged shares would have fallen in market value by or million by earlier this month had he taken no precautions the return on the diversified exchange fund isnt the rule was lifted employees like mr green could get out of their dell holdings only by withdrawing money from their accounts paying income tax and a penalty on the withdrawal and then reinvesting the says dell spokesman mike they could have elected to take their compensation and not put it in their and invest it in some other stock by doing so however they would have forgone the matching contribution altogether mr declines to comment on mr dells transactions he notes that like executives regular employees who receive options are free to sell their shares were all playing by the same rules he hedging maneuvers executives can employ to protect their company holdings fall largely off the radar screens of regulators and shareholders while the sec generally requires that key executives report these transactions experts say the rules are largely ignored we really are only able to uncover several a month at most which leads me to believe that the insiders are not filing these as often as they should says

starting jan the company began allowing managers to diversify company stock contributions they receive this year into other investments available through the plan the restrictions on union members he says are covered by the collective bargaining fact is mr responds in an email the majority of companies in the us that match employee contributions do so in their own company stock a good number also restrict employees from diversifying out of the company the federal law governing pension plans provides employees with little legal traction to complain about their forced holdings employer contributions to plans arent generally subject to fiduciary rules as for employee contributions employers are supposed to choose prudent investment plans are exempt from diversification rules too these rules make it illegal for a pension plan to invest more than of its assets in the own securities but savings plans such as can generally invest as much as of the assets in company stock with impunity currently roughly to of assets at large companies are invested in company stock that suits employers which would just as soon contribute stock as draw down precious cash and in the past they have lobbied successfully to defeat efforts to impose diversification rules on confounds people such as mr the technician at portland general electric unit anyone will tell you that you need to

official the united states is in a was the word monday from the national bureau of economic research a recession by the by comes about after six months of declining economic activity in this case the bureau said the recession started last march so were already through almost nine months of theres something very different about this recession different from all the others weve experienced in the past four or five decades we were not led into it by a huge oversupply of all kinds of real estate and a collapse in those current recession was sparked by a collapse led by a glut of technology doesnt mean real estate will sail through untouched this recession there are places that will be hurting san francisco comes to mind it is a center and there was a lot of building to accommodate that is also one real estate sector in trouble the hotel industry it had already been hurt by a downturn in business travel the sept terrorist attacks sent it and air travel theres nothing like we saw back in the remember when houston enriched the nations vocabulary by coming up with the term buildings those were the many skyscrapers in houston that had been built but never finished inside so you could look right through them because there were no interior if real estate is a bright spot in this recession real estate in houston is a great shining office building market is tight the downtown office market has an percent vacancy rate and prime class a space prized by major corporations is effectively full there should be some easing of that rate corp with its has almost completed a new headquarters even more space will be coming onto the market when the center office tower is completed at texas ave in development has announced it is working on a office tower downtown crescent real estate equities is building a tower on the other side of main street all this plus cutbacks at continental airlines and the pending sale of computer corp to co will doubtless hurt the office market but no one is predicting houston apartment market may be the nations healthiest with percent of apartments occupied in the third quarter of this year that figure is almost a full percentage point higher than the year before prices for apartments are up as are of used homes in october were the highest ever with the median price up percent sales are setting are how did we escape the usual credit estate developing is full of optimists ask any developer even in the midst of a bust and hell tell you it wont affect his building which somehow is nicer sexier or even more than the next guys give a developer money and he will have been as tight as the bark on trees that has forced developers to prelease buildings and seek partners with equity primarily pension funds before the banks would loan them money for new things happen to the real estate business during a recession prices fall or stabilize and in this particular recession the bet is probably on stabilization the banks and others that loan that money generally tighten credit standards cutting off weaker real estate players and the federal reserve board helps out the economy by lowering rates which aids bargain hunters with deep any recession even one that is as benign to real estate as this one some properties wont survive the economic downturn and owners will have to sell or file for the current low interest rates companies with good credit will move in and buy those properties remember the vulture funds of the soon this process starts will determine the length of this recession because real estate is in good shape this time the process is not as important as it was in the still if investors promptly snap up distressed properties that will increase the odds that this recession will be a short gains on optimism

hour counts in this situation core trading business is in deep trouble as power market players cut exposure to the company draining it of precious a result two options exist from here the first is a rescue effort involving the rating agencies and bank creditors like morgan chase and working to revise the merger agreement and find more cash to buy time this could involve changing the ratio to give a cheaper price with the banks possibly extending debt and joining with other investors to inject other scenario has after seeing the cash hemorrhage and the skeletons in the closet deciding to back out altogether leaving with no rescuer and no future but resilient stock price suggests that the market hasnt grasped the impact an bankruptcy would have on and other trading be at all surprised if any moment now we see one last attempt to salvage rescue merger with new terms several banks are exposed to and presumably they will try almost anything including extending debt to keep the company afloat by keeping deeply distressed at an rating rating agencies such as have shown themselves willing to bend to the banks wishes so they will probably capitulate again if pressured by bank careful what you wish swallowing would hardly be good for which appears to have underestimated the formers just a couple of weeks back the company expected to make per share in is now expecting cents even if the merger gets done if ended up paying say a share for people would no doubt hail that as a price to cover worsened fundamentals legal liabilities and any nasty surprises that could spring from notoriously murky books but recall that also would be taking on billion of debt include the debt in some calculations and the deal still looks may be deteriorating too fast to save thats also bad for the damage done to the company by depleted energy market activity has been recognized as has the risk that an collapse could leave dangerously unhedged on many of its trades what does that mean and why is it dangerous lets say agreed to buy power from company x over a period of time and then sell it to if goes down its obligation to buy from obviously disappears but cant easily back out of the commitment to buy power from company theres another potential risk that the market really hasnt recognized allegedly was very aggressive in booking profits on forward market deals an spokesman declined to comment on that allegation those deals had to be done with other trading houses possibly other words ways may have contaminated the whole market because as we are frequently told was the energy market just as was the junk bond market in the in absence many of the aggressive deals may have to be unwound meanwhile auditors in a frantic bid to cover their behinds would start telling trading companies to be a lot more conservative in how much profit they book on forward deals suddenly fat margin deals evaporate and earnings estimates get for both jones news c dow jones company column was first published michael dow jones york dow jones if you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust corp heres another piece of evidence one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the doesnt simply trade for less than its book value it fell below that milestone weeks ago no now it trades for less than of its book a rare level for a company of size and prominence and it may mean among other things that investors have decided that they simply cant place any further faith in the veracity of earnings and figures as theyve been something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company lets be clear about what this means stock is currently about a share the reported book value is about a share in other words stock sells for less than of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate were to turn all its assets into cash pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give whats left over to is an uncommonly dismal level for any company even a troubled one for comparisons sake inc dyn which has agreed to buy trades at about three times book value as does el paso corp a competitor of both companies in fact has the ratio of any company in the standard index only inc another troubled company is lower by an of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that agreement to buy will fall apart and the belief that will have to file for bankruptcy if it does in which case shareholders would be to realize any value the deal now amounts to about per share itself well under book value the huge premium that level offers over current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal wont be consummated in its current given current woes its certainly also possible that is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors dont feel they can trust the earnings and numbers coming out of those numbers after all are the raw material that form the basis for valuing or any other company by computing figures like and the debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers with shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted in terms of those numbers the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships when it restated nearly five years worth of earnings downward by a total of million and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a million note that deadline has now been extended until dec youve gotten punched in the face three times its not unreasonable to fear therell be a fourth blow no matter how much the puncher assures you there wont be given insanely complicated structure and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks who can guarantee there arent more such shocks yet to what investors appear to be fearing and that may be part of the reason stock has fallen so precipitously thanks to repeated demonstrations that its numbers cant be relied on investors no longer have a firm trustworthy basis on which to value the stock and so not surprisingly the value is getting down to the most conservative spokesman couldnt be reached for ironic in a way for a long time it was hard to properly value because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher now its hard to properly value because the attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that its hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy
