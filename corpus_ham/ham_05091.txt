one can question on the football field a yard touchdown entrenched as the patriots starter keep in mind the a bye in week stewart stewart looked good on sunday with his multiple touchdown game stewart finished the game with yards rushing yards and total touchdowns the schedule for stewart down the stretch especially with games against detroit in weeks and jay has found a quality weapon in rookie has been an up and down quarterback this season but is good a quality schedule throughout the remainder of the allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy alex van pelt since stepping into the lineup for rob johnson has been a fantasy star with two consecutive yards games with touchdowns van pelt deserves starter consideration opponents look for another quality performance against the dominic rhodes with james sidelined for the season been asked to do a lot in the colts offense he produced on sunday total yards and touchdowns two consecutive difficult games and miami will slow rhodes down but a strong finish to the in store with manning and the passing game throwing interceptions coach mora to run a more conservative offense featuring smith smith jumps into the upgrades category once again total yards and touchdowns however now is the time to trade his value has hit an high and the remainder of the be difficult with cleveland miami and a bye week green green has struggled the last few weeks but was able out on thanksgiving day with total yards and scores look green bay offense to revolve around green for the remainder of as the winter weather approaches and the passing game more conservative which will result in more dump off passes to green dont be surprised if green receives of the statistics have suffered over several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run in order to ball in hands more often turner called several plays to get lt in the open field the plan was successful caught passes for yards the fantasy playoffs look good with oakland kansas city and seattle on the schedule for and garrison hearst hearst looked strong again on sunday with and touchdowns in the last games hearst has averaged with rookie kevan barlow separating his shoulder to go along with an already injured quad hearst will continue to touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy long as he remains derrick alexander good news for alexander appears that healthy for the first time this eric moulds throughout the week moulds was complaining about of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him complaint department contacted management and moulds got the ball when the ball was thrown to moulds he produced yards and chris chambers the talented rookie struck once again on sunday receiving yards and fabulous touchdowns chambers is the big in the miami offense and should continue to see action keep chambers is a option at receiver hell dazzle you one disappear the next week this guy is going to be special so grab dynasty david boston plain and man a few weeks ago the boston was his lack of touchdown scoring well touchdowns in quiet the kevin johnson johnson jumped back in the scoring column on yards and a touchdown johnson is tim clear cut and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of troy brown brown continues to produce quality numbers on a with catches for yards and a touchdown on sunday to have a quality rapport with tom keep in mind has a bye in week so brown will not be available for of championship games plan trent green greens disappointing season continues he looked passing yards and zero interceptions on sunday however he to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade healthy return of alexander at wide receiver greens stock could be rise in the near future greens value is at its lowest point so probably get him for relatively cheap hes not an every but he might have a few big games left for this donovan has looked horrendous in the pocket over two weeks passing yards and touchdown his pride of wanting tobe a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make right now should still be considered a top however if his lack of production continues his stock brian receiving options are limited which affecting his production rod smith limped through thursdays an ankle injury a healthy return of smith will boost needs some quality production from the other his production is limited if he is forced to throw to the position the majority of the did not a touchdown for time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the difficult challenge at is upcoming this anthony thomas thomas was held out of sundays game with a hes expecting to play this weekend against detroit but this a guarantee with james allen being effective it would not surprise see the bears hold thomas out for another game to ensure a for the stretch run towards the playoffs a big game looms in against green bay and the bears will need a healthy thomas in smith smith was held to yards on carries during day game until the cowboys can establish a passing numbers will remain ron with tiki barber establishing himself as the first the rushing game fantasy value has dropped very low yards on carries barber had rushing yards on carries for yards and a touchdown keep on your jason broke his foot in sundays game against he is expected to be out for weeks drop him and add to the eddie george disappointing season continues with yards carries this past sunday george is currently tied with randy moss disappointment of the maurice smith smith sprained his ankle on sunday and managed to the game however smith gained a meager yards on seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain evaluate his progress jimmy smith smith tested positive for cocaine in his system pulled over by police no legal action will occur but some sort could be handed down by the commissioners office not a as we head closer to the fantasy peter suffered a bruised shoulder against sunday he was held to reception for yards and has not scored since week of the season keep him on your bench until passing game randy moss moss was held to yards on catches sunday night the most talented receiver in the league but appears to from time to time keep in mind his potential for is in mind the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of and alex van pelt since stepping into the lineup for rob johnson has been a fantasy star with two consecutive yards games with touchdowns van pelt deserves starter consideration james allen allen stepped in for the injured anthony thomas admirably with thomas bothered by a hamstring injury possible that allen could start against the lowly detroit lions defense is strong and the bears like to grind it out travis minor with smith averaging just over games minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon in touches minor has looked good and could give the dolphins offense needed chris chambers this guy is good see description in eddie boo williams i had williams on the list last week and on sunday deserves another mention although he had just catches yards williams has explosive potential he nearly scored on a play but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last cam remaining out with an injury williams is a tight end analytics inc all rights reserved
