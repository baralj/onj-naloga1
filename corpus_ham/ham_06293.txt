ut on respond to inside ut football image to brown the dallas morning news texas writer answers about what went wrong against stanford coach mack browns the loss the continuing quarterback controversy ut players in the more inside ut football appears every to chip brown talk about the longhorns colleges year since texas has lost or tied a game in its first four the season that means ut has had a blemish on its record each of the years usually before weekend spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its they spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and tickets they dream big dreams and then by october the high usually come crashing those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie and in each of those seasons texas ended up with in uts two best seasons since a campaign in and a in the longhorns lost their second and third games of the before texas can dream about winning a national title have to show they can make it into october without a q it looks like the trend of blitzing the horns will continue there no respect for our running game from any team that we face i think way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is order for us to achieve this i think it starts with us putting our on the field on offense these guys may not be the most but they will gain experience with playing time and they have to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz its time to williams and johnson at receiver along with flowers a offensive set our fullbacks are not a threat offensively mitchell is not an who is adept at following the the hole strength is operating in space and making in the open also think chris needs to get the bulk of the minutes at has all the intangibles in the world but could does possess all of the same skills he just hasnt had the display them we desperately need to have all on the field are going to turn this thing around if not i could see this to real quick what are your thoughts the jackson coaches players even the bus driver you do that and you are team that you have absolutely no confidence in them there cant be change at any one time the big question is how the team responds stanford loss emotionally something tells me if texas can find and perform really well see some solid performances at positions where problems currently exist in texas was no dame was no texas had the game won in austin and then lost ut three of its next four which included games against oklahoma and colorado all teams texas is about to face after this was a different coach and different players but the common thread texas hit the top and then choked if texas is hung over from to stanford trouble could be on the horizon if texas can find show everyone that stanford truly was a game in which everything go wrong did then i think the longhorns will bounce back and be a to beat the rest of the way tuesday night mack brown said the not a very good football team right now the challenge has been made team if they come out and stink against houston every position will every coach even the bus driver there will be enough thrown in austin to serve up grilled for the entire state will have to be made constructively and mitch he was practicing with the first team on tuesday that has been whoever practices with the first team gets the start anyway how they respond after the stanford game major was erratic play despite almost leading the longhorns back from the dead to victory im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to can do against houston before picking one or the other get solo duty in the oklahoma and colorado games if one struggles along the way the other will come in but said they primarily went with against stanford because experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road they still have all the faith in the world in it would seem to it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense up and get on a roll when you are alternating but ill continue to everyone else keep trying to remind myself that brown did this twice at north success of course with those oscar davenport and chris had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense for davenports scrambling and passing with you pretty much get the same style with and also had injuries dictate a few against game and major has been around a long time i was panic i thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great coming back and giving us a chance to win sometimes youth doesnt it is trying because theyre nervous instead they are trying too get uptight our team tried hard as negative as people make it is one of those things that you have to grow from problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from or dave ball they do however say that chris ball will come a and a little harder than major are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts i a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount chad suffer a injury the chance for a redshirt is out anderson linebacker if i remember correctly he played lb in high school at he seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on weight to play defensive end it just seems like he might be for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering made by young defensive ends like cole micah pleased with the depth at linebacker as well they like as a pass rusher they are still working on his ability to stop schedule in your letter each week my husband mark is a who was transferred to oklahoma in through thick and thin he a loyal longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the of course he does his fair share and probably more of bragging longhorns barbara and mark home vs houston at pm on home vs oklahoma state at am on in dallas vs oklahoma at

trends in mack browns program your feedback mack brown is a great recruiter no argument can he motivate it seems like he cant get the team up cant adjust the teams mood during a offensive coordinator greg davis i dont know who is responsible offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than put it under him with guys the size that ut has shouldnt even be able to run who tagged leonard davis as a pro why does mitchell sure he gained yards last year but how many yards were the chains type of runs that allowed ut to hold the ball on the a lead i thought it was going to be running back by committee we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning and using the wrong back for the wrong can run to the outside but he cannot run through the and even if he does get holes he still will never break through for a td why not put ivan williams or kenny back mitchell and go with a offense you dont lose as is a nice smart stanford i loved his hitting when he played safety but his have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep opponents is the defensive end position shaping up the defensive tackles the field against stanford but the des didnt make much noise what with the blocked punts ut should be really really embarrassed take too long is he too close to the line can the line block at ut brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls several camera caught clear holds by line why on earth would you the middle on your own goal line against two of the best andrew pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last but in talking to mack brown on tuesday he said its fair to team up for not being able to run the ball but he said to jump on part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are what it takes to compete as a be fair to brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive and some positions on the offensive line and at corner it fair to question whether mack brown can motivate because his teams nebraska twice oklahoma twice and texas if a trend texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair whether brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head straight but its typical after losses to want to shred every part of said before the season that as soon as something went wrong situation would be blamed and he was right the are hard and look for to start this week against houston question that the is struggling but so are the backs and so receivers brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of he said the other three were caused by miscommunication and the receivers causing to hold the ball too was standing too deep in the backfield against stanford so it him too long to get to the holes the coaches were not happy they were yelling at him to move up he should only be but he was sometimes at yards mitchell also struggled with pickup which is uncharacteristic of him so look for victor and possibly williams to get a little time against are still high on jammer again he hasnt played corner much after moving from safety but coaches are not thinking of moving defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator he is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a can really play cory redding was better than usual against stanford position still needs a lot of work the blocked punt occurred player who blocked perfectly on other punts saturday night failed a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom that been chewed out every which far as the penalties there were several questionable calls but did a lot of yelling at officials during the stanford game couldnt about it after the game because he would be fined texas can a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out will help in that direction well see if texas takes this or he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player country in ive waited all to see him explode this year i havent seen it yet maybe this week against stanford is why was he moved from his high school position of he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems average is texas that low on defensive line talent it seems has been great please help me understand hook em ernie he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the away as a defensive end coaches also feel that his body for the de position hes tall athletic fast and has long arms coaches feel redding will develop into an player but no question that he has struggled against the run he made some big stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses an extra point attempt he is just a sophomore over this season next two years he should only get stated that had anted up for the campaign how much did ut spend on its campaign for run for the a video and a screen saver to send out to the detailing accomplishments but those costs totaled less according to ut in the stanford game i am watching to see which ones might mike smith austin was the only freshman to play against the cardinal not play against in addition to here thomas te brock edwards de cb nathan and dt have yet to win a single conference championship since ut has out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to houston this end mack browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding pr program with brown about to land his third national top class i believe fans are going to expect more gridiron go with those recruiting victories t at appalachian state north carolina and now texas state and unc he was taking over absolutely he took to a bowl and he had florida state to deal with atlantic coast conference while at unc but he took unc to six bowl his years at unc and won four of loss to houston would certainly intensify the frustration of but i think anyone who would be looking to put brown on the or rip him if texas lost to houston would be overlooking the job he beating nebraska twice oklahoma twice and texas in two seasons here he has also turned texas back into a for top recruits and brought the ut community back together to all that he has done more good for ut out of the limelight most texas fans is now in the same spotlight as bobby bowden john cooper lloyd spurrier and phil any unexpected losses are unforgivable in of fans it may take some time for brown and his team to adjust to fans were pretty about everything the tar heels did in when they won big brown wanted to win at a school with hell have to adjust now that it appears texas will be the next few seasons in the top marty stanford he may also miss the oklahoma state game mack brown is a bad week to be without jackson because houston can throw the mark he will be there because the new orleans saints are off that communications has also just finished a video biography on williams be available loss to virginia overrated i didnt see any reason with the youth the way we year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been football team one of the great things about texas is that you tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people push you too fast to get to the top i think that we were in that expectations got out of hand i knew that we would have a difficult stanford and that it would be a tough game to win i also didnt we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country our current rank top is much more fitting for where we are today if you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to find or change your password modify your
