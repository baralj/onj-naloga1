and please send to your morning with state session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at taking action without including them in the decision making process although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame it was a long morning i will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general to of the were supportive of and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts most of these comments came from the midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support everyone else was fairly verbal against primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens in particular the commissioners from maryland and north carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric while many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend sarah thought it was disgusting in my mind it was to a legislative of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the maryland commission and immediately implied that was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department she then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record it went on like this for about minutes the good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an and i bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of his comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are she also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they to portray himself and california as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the washington commission his comments he delivered the same messages that weve been hearing should have acted sooner on price caps etc was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc he was very supportive of makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any to be effective it must have independent very parochial in her discussion but echoed don comments from earlier in the week that one for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be got the gold star for the day after very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said get it essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move the commissioner standpoint the gold star went to after hearing over and over again about how the didnt feel that they had been included and that had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an been talking for years and never could me if i can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting sue
