want to help forward this email to your friends then if contribution link at talking points to set the record statement by secretary james a baker what theyre points to set the record been once for the presidency of the united states every ballot in was counted at least twice election night and again during the automatic recount in every election there are a significant number of are cast by voters without choosing a candidate race on the ballot including races for president for example in this election of the voters in of the voters in illinois and of the voters cast a ballot without registering a vote for president the votes actually according to their which the gore campaign has been complaining of the ballots cast in these counted twice they merely registered no vote a candidate for the senate house or other office but about the choice for president in particular who usually votes for candidates from one party for local or statewide candidates but be his or her choice for president and to vote for the other candidate so he might cast a ballot without marking a choice in some of the recount gore would actually be votes democrats get to this number by adding unreported votes from the late manual recount in palm from the partial manual recount from and the valid military overseas ballots and some certified votes from nassau county the florida supreme court set a deadline of pm on completing manual recounts almost tripling the period for counting mandated by legislature palm beach did not complete its manual recount by the deadline returned to its original decision of with a manual recount the interim gain for gore in came from recount of the most democrat precincts gore selected precincts by approximately to won the entire county only by to it would to use this interim change without counting too precincts in including predominantly hispanic and cuban american bush the gore approach would treat these a discriminatory fashion military overseas ballots that were valid under florida law should be counted counties recognized this them even joe said that such should not be the republican mob that intimidated the canvassing county before the mob stopped the count but i to say that a mob can storm a counting facility stop and then thats going to provide the end because of the bush campaign ms harris refuses to and cuts off the counting i dont think thats of end that we have to american morning america abc the record shows that the crowd was reacting to the to move the recount behind closed doors where not be observed by the public or the media and to recount to only a select set of the votes no board member mentioned the protests as a factor in and judge of the board has already that he was not intimidated by the crowd the police made no arrests received no assault did not even instruct the crowd to desist the crowd votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected board as illegal on election night all the votes were counted but during recount ballots were accidentally separated rest and not counted as a result bush received votes and gore received fewer votes than on after the recount the nassau county board her mistake and tried to correct it because court of florida had held the date open for informed the supervisor that she could revise to make it accurate the board democrats and republican voted unanimously the original election night count which included ballots rather than the machine recount total omitted those by secretary james a baker and the gore campaign has now filed a the certified election results in florida is to overturn the outcome of the election after days and i said last night america has never had a decided by a contest of the election outcome in is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering and controversial i would now like to introduce the senior members litigation team who will be defending the vote in favor of governor bush and secretary have earlier

dont think he should us senator russ tribune rep gene taylor st louis mississippi will vote gov george w bush if the presidential race is by the us house of will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the district voted and in this case governor my district the mississippi sun herald indiana house speaker john gregg called to end the disputes that have kept the presidential doubt for needs to pick up the phone call austin and say congratulations i support you as president indianapolis star liberal democrat pat on talking about people that they said their count there are other people in florida were not counted that lie in george bush more are bush votes and they dont say a word about lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine and logic and cannot say of the ballot just because nobody voted for gore that its really a secret gore vote that didnt condescending singsong delivery of a bland speech was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it and howard on in the were reversed how would i wouldnt want to include you but how would the liberal weenies of the news media all this if the roles were a cry baby that he was the spoiled son of a you know you can just here it the personal bush would be just absolutely sometimes get that has turned off many americans over you also got a little bit of whining frankly when talking about voter in there flashing it was a bit distracting flags some people think maybe its an overdose on the with the american about him some essential goodness in him that worth fighting this fight and when he said if i lose it he had to be convincing on that point and i must all the arguing in this very divided election its be hard for most americans to agree with americans think that this election was fair hes make the case that it isnt and its hard for him to do terms im not sure how much time he really for by bush cheney change
