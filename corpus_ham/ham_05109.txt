if a dog were the teacher you would learn stuff like when loved ones come home always run to greet them never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure ecstasy when its in your best interest practice obedience let others know when theyve invaded your territory take naps stretch before rising run romp and play daily thrive on attention and let people touch you avoid biting when a simple growl will do on warm days stop to lie on your back on the grass on hot days drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree when youre happy dance around and wag your whole body no matter how often youre scolded dont buy into the guilt thing and right back and make friends delight in the simple joy of a long walk eat with gusto and enthusiasm stop when you have had enough be loyal never pretend to be something youre not if what you want lies buried dig until you find it when someone is having a bad day be silent sit close by and nuzzle them gently and finally never trust anyone until you sniff their butt
