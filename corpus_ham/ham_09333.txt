in mind also that if the variance was or could be used it is based off of the total volume to the plant not a comparison of their to the measured number charlie has calculated this a number of times happens next is that rick craig is meeting with john soon to discuss the numbers has not given any specific reason they disagree with our numbers if they admit their only basis for disagreeing with our numbers is that the variance was big in april or may our answer to them will be that size of the variance between metered numbers and no longer matters that issue was decided in our favor in the arbitration in fact rick your reference to a variance threshold is confusing to me because there is no or any in the agreement our meters govern no matter how big or little the so called variance gets unless calls a special test and proves a malfunction britt is talking to rick and ricks role will be to simply listen to on this no debate or argument at the meeting we will convene after ricks meeting to discuss whether to go to court to enforce the arbitration award sent us their statement for july this afternoon the good news is they used northerns ultrasonic meters as the basis for their calculation the variance between their calculated plant and our measured plant volumes was only three hundredths of one the variance was less than of one percent they are bound by the plant agreement to use the ultrasonic metered volumes were pleased the variance is so minor however we cannot determine whether is using our metered volumes because of the arbitrators ruling or whether it is simply because the variance is below the you will recall june was also within the tolerance and used our metered volumes april and may were outside of this tolerance and used their calculated plant method as the basis for calculating the and is disputing our measurement for these two do we go from
