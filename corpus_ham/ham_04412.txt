hi jump right into our upgraded and downgraded players as we head home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines head into our week of listing these players inevitable players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list make understand what talking about is players that are moving words a player like te chad lewis could appear on the downgrade still be good enough to be a starter in your league it just means about the way he seems to be heading likewise a player like coles may make the upgrade list even though still fairly the list of all about which direction players are moving an eye on these trends can very often make all the and downgrades some of these players are obvious moves up or some arent as clear heres my list of guys i see moving this moving jeff blake no heard a funny thing on monday night the guys said that with the troubles in st louis the road to bowl now runs through new orleans its been a while since able to say that blake struggled in the preseason but has become with each game with a great rushing game featuring and a star wr in joe horn looking trent bal shannon predicted that when the ravens scored a td theyd score a bunch of them the big te was threw for sunday he scrambled improvised and decisions a little confidence may be all he needed he a stellar wr corps with lewis and patrick but he does have a great te in and a solid in brian den as expected recent off the field little impact to his performance on the field yards and a is strong against a good jets team the biggest reason for though is the smashing return of davis if sunday indication this offense could make some serious king tb with back to back solid games king is turning heads he only passed for yards sunday but squeezed every yard it was worth with he continued to target johnson the point of forcing the ball in places it probably shouldnt have been its tough to rely on a who plays in this conservative offense if youre thin at king might be worth a jim miller chi miller clearly gave the bears a boost with his solid sunday not only was he more accurate than the injured cade a better arm to boot millers gain will be lost and i miller to gain plenty over the next few danny came in when chandler left with a he played pretty well with on yards chandler possibly miss this weeks game and could be a nice play against moving smith mia hes made this list several times already this its worth noting how good hes been lately sundays td day earned him the ranking in many scoring systems i dont reasons why he wont have continued davis den in one of the more heartening performances of the davis looked great he showed the power and the burst that come to expect from davis over the years coach mike said last weeks practices that davis looked as good as hed ever seen after watching the game i have to agree with jr ne according to coach bill and boston frank injured his foot during practice and going to be limited sunday kevin was unimpressive never looked back after getting a chance hes being impressive as he only averaged yards per carry on but did get the lewis bal much had been made of the ravens troubles but had been running hard and effectively lewis was held out of the once again but he rolled up total yards with rushing and receiving if trent and the passing game can keep things i see no reason why lewis cant hold up his end of the justin watson as you know by now marshall had knee surgery and will miss weeks weve had watson on our waiver wire for a while as the guy whod get a shot if went down he was than impressive yesterday with only yards on carries but he the td plus coach mike said the game plan had been and the skills he brings look for watson to perform a week to prepare although marshall is the only guy wholl like numbers anytime soon in this had carries sunday and he continues to play role in this offense its coming at the expense of mike strange to see carry the load but thats exactly what hes after the minnesota game last week johnson said he told king that he needed to get the ball to and johnson and evidently listened makes you wonder really coaching this sd looked to be in danger of losing week but he responded sunday with a nice day carrying the ball yards he also tacked on yards receiving the still struggling but could be a nice addition if youre thin moving johnson tb johnson told king he wanted the obliged and made the most of it he only had yards but he managed on of those catches i dont look for score every other time he touches he ball down the stretch but i do could continue the roll you can bet the wont mess around working for joe horn no can you imagine if elvis still had joe horn in jeff certainly glad to have him and horn surely likes the role wr he put together a great game sunday with yards on wr keith isnt carrying his share of the load but williams is more than making up for louis id look for isaac bruce hakim and holt increase their production in the wake of marshall injury can be a strange thing on most teams id view the loss of the as a negative toward the the rams have so many passing i think they can carry the team with a lesser in the donald hayes car apparently the loss of wesley walls can be hayes made some great plays sunday not unlike only caught passes but he made the most of them with yards and he looks to be back on muhammad car i received a few asking how in the world i continue to rank muhammad as high as i did last week hes good how sure the rams had something to do with his play and the but i like his activity he caught passes for yards sunday and should continue to play derrick mason ten i said a few weeks ago that mason could be the best on the team now im sure of it of course its a team that the ball very well and when they do throw the te is the primary still though hes a solid contributor and you could certainly do at wr his special teams play is a nice bonus if your league lets double dip the wr and special teams coles coles continues to play great football as the wr over the last games keep an eye on him for as his play is very encouraging considering his lack of should only get robinson chi i told you robinson doesnt seem to care the ball and robinson came through sunday with yards and a jim miller definitely gave the bears a spark and robinson it dont be surprised to see him keep it moving shannon led the charge as the ravens came hes clearly the best receiver on the team and you can bet will continue feeding him the ricky dudley oak dudley was a guy who kept raising eyebrows on our even though he made the downgrade list a couple of we kept him fairly high on the overall list just based on finally showed some of that potential sunday with a couple of worth noting that he scored in of them came in half of the jay seemed less rusty sunday as he receptions for yards will probably get another start and look for him to continue leaning on the big moving moving donovan only completed of his passes even for the ones he completed he only averaged yards per which is a bad sign he doesnt seem to and progression youd like to see from a with his charlie batch det batch was banged around repeatedly sunday he left with a concussion and his status for this week will be probably by wednesday youve probably seen it by now but ross resigned i doubt thatll have too much effect on the drew ne suffered a very brett like banged up as he hit a defenders helmet he was in obvious pain on the and looked extremely frustrated not being able to play x negative but hes still hampered by it theyll make a decision on week but even if he can go he could be chris chandler once again chandler was led off the field looking drunk it wasnt pretty danny actually played pretty could get the start this moving corey as expected the dream became reality vs a tough defense i traded him in my league last week and hope you did ill say it again a can only do so much when there is threat of the throwing the ball smith is world class mike tb as becomes a bigger part of the is playing a reduced role part of the reason is likely fumbling problems but the effectiveness of is playing a part im that and said to give it to anders kc the featured back in kc had carries sunday ever trust a kansas city no matter what i might tell you in the dont believe it theyll break your heart every travis prentice prentice averaged yards per carry wont get it done like a lesser version of corey beware who dont scare anyone throwing the ball doug moving johnnie morton det inability to take up the slack for the germane has been a huge disappointment he came up small sunday and one has to wonder what will change in the francisco and he had a better day than green tb like is suffering in the wake of success green is suffering as johnson commands more he only had receptions and simply isnt getting the looks he earlier in the dal in whats become the uncomfortable norm dallas has another wr to knee surgery there was so much promise this summer smith joey galloway and things carl ten injured his hamstring again this week high on him coming over to the titans but hes been a non mason is the best wr on the team by a moving chad lewis phi after a hot start lewis has struggled of late as bracket him with no wr to take some heat on the downfield not too hard to shut down the te until and charles small get going his troubles will likely tony should be a nice weapon for the struggling smith but he doesnt seem to be utilizing him as youd expect he only passes sunday the sad part is that almost made him the
