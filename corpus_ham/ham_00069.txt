isnt in this business for all of us they need to clear outwith people like herr hair peace governor lets do lynch who needs a friday burrito they redefine each week with aplomb for example starting june the was ordered to compete for business against trading vehicles then two weeks later the energy that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for one year this week the approved bilateral deals and thereby opening the to competition and block forward market zip bam cant wait to see what next week will bring i hear senator committee hearings on re regulating the industry and for will sit at the head of the anyone have good seats for next weeks democratic there anyone we havent indicted yet in the power will crank up the air conditioning in this room its getting they will collect data from innocent businesses under the facts and publish a report it makes one want to take adeep breath and inhale the scented fumes of know i cant think about where to begin so lets start somewhere things on the island of california is there anyone left at with a brain the issues its scathing report the iso invokes price caps things at the throne of amen for the morgan stanley order odds and ends things on the island of california is there anyone left at with a the answer very clearly is no i have been astounded by of most senior people to ape humans but instead the following first they waltz their default customers summer with little of no protection from price spikes in market forgivable in that it is human to err the in june and they start looking for who to blame must damn independent say their managers gary the iso governing board that hedging position in forward market wouldnt have made any difference theres laureate who missed his under pressure they ask for help from suppliers and anyone will assist the utility and their customers nine offers show up table and they cant choose any of them again mr cotton fellow iso governing board members that these things take time dont to rush since there are many legislative barriers and surfing was good this week so why spoil they are in a panic because the energy fhrer is visiting old in trailer parks advising them not to pay their bill and to continue to operate their air puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone is doing everything it can to lower their electric asking the iso for a price cap but the public can calling the iso address and phone number provided in the ad them to lower the cap i always thought the location of the a state secret for security reasons no secrets in san we are not done no sir we are not those buffalo heads who company decide they will win a gold star on their and implement one of the four resolutions passed by oversight board the one they pick is to petition on basis to cap at the price at which sellers may or ancillary services into the iso and the the is that western power markets are not workably competitive words they want to set a max price on what generators in addition to the price limit at which the iso can i find most astounding about this double talk is that to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must into the these are sales from their stranded assets hasnt abated their to recap missed the boat on price hedging failed to confidence in public meetings asked for help from did nothing in response then filed at to cap the sale the wholesale market into which they sell overpriced not workably competitive too much time in the direct sun light things on the island of california the issues its scathing report released yesterday is a gem with which i have not time i only read the executive summary and that only counsel dan forwarded me a copy let me pick out some gems in president lets do burrito i would the whole text if you have time and if you seek is experiencing major problems with electricity supply caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past since june wholesale prices for electrical power in california on average over the same period in resulting billion in excess payments for weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets drive prices up because of serious market defects and tight supply of of california power will likely pay billions more costs this year moreover these price increases do fund new investments in electricity supply or they may flow solely to power producer profit the electricity oversight boards legislative mandate those institutions we have been unable to obtain bid we believe enough evidence of questionable that the attorney general should conduct an investigation statewide market practices coordinating with other including the and the such an investigation the factual foundation that california policy makers need to recover any illegally obtained momentous consequence of attempt to create a market is that the federal government now regulates system washington dc now controls pricing decisions the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and to that supply incentives are correlated to prices washington affects ability to attract new investment in administrations willingness to cede the states authority to government combined with the legislative creation of supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect or consider the retail customer the independent iso and the power exchange the nonprofit that operate the states transmission system and pricing policies are governed by boards whose members serious conflicts of interest some of these board members or financially benefit from higher prices in electricity of these private organizations is accountable to the state consumers despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the services the state of california should protect its consumers from cartel pricing collusive behavior inadequate maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance as did not this summer how and when the price of an like electricity will double california is now by federal mandates from providing comprehensive relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high if to reimpose a price freeze in san diego now federal likely prevent that action price relief resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing by federal have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know iso and failed to detect manipulation and gaming on we do not know how market players acted in price offering and scheduling the has just announced an inquiry intonational pricing and energy market issues california should not national findings before it investigates california we recommend that the california attorney general relevant records and data to determine the pricing and of market participants the actions of the iso and its and the actions of generators in supplying actions to consider or act upon to prevent current create a california energy council modeled on the council to unify state action to resolve and to perform integrated energy ask for extended wholesale price cap authority california wholesale market ask to recognize the defects in the california regional markets and find that no competitive in california power eliminate potential conflicts of interest in improve ability to obtain iso and and enhance the states enforcement capability for maintenance price manipulation and generation with protection of proprietary provide the with effective enforcement ability oversight authority for the iso and streamline state power plant siting procedures environmental requirements and prioritize advance clean bact power plant institute or permitting power and emissions credits rules to ensure power reform pricing protocols and structures to and retail prices and reduce excess told you i dont need to write a burrito anymore the democrats are doing that for me welcome comrade things on the island of california the iso invokes price caps is really hard to describe the drama of an iso governing especially when our favorite topic arises it seems the the board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on its pretty much and round we went once again a few more forced votes scale in favor of the cap there were yes votes which forced yes vote from our friend jerry by order of secretary mr richardson jerry did you realize that the last letters name could be rearranged to spell no et yeso kind of a im sorry about that vote jerry you still go in my book of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of so long your picture in the sf chron said it brave souls who stood tall and voted no included david jan barbara dan and stacy roscoe i must admit that greg blue did help by voting a texas i have instructed trader dave houston to work with greg to correct that problem were going things energy fhrer addressed the board again i didnt mind that i a few brief very brief moments to address the board and peace got over minutes that didnt bother me at all more damage to himself in than i could do in he blasted everyone who opposed him he pined about camden quitting the said he knew how prices and markets work that it isnt the way egghead economists tell you who pray to the competition he lambasted for withholding generation to and wildlife what was that all about he predicted that meeting he and all the other powerful and angry citizens of san diego would demand that the a rate cap on retail electric rates in san diego that are reasonable it didnt happen and on and on and on this man delusional he believes that steve and only steve peace can world he believes that political will trumps or independent board actions this man makes the abstract musings of the philosopher the will to power the bermensch the transvaluation we are getting under his skin with the help of the afternoon i called commissioner dick to see if whether the next days meeting was going to be a roll said he got a call from peace and that peace said he would to the meeting apparently peace had received a lot of press of it the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one from our front door things at the throne of amen for the morgan stanley now the good news you deserve this gave the a little wiggle room last friday issued a last to the complaint by morgan stanley capital group relating to intent to lower the price cap denied the complaint didnt waste time with an order to simply deny a complaint on the head of the iso and pulled the bite out of the price accepted this amendment not because it was a cap on but because it would promote order and transparency in the clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the iso was willing and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether in the iso market or to sell elsewhere the iso has no more or less ability to procure capacity and any other buyer of these services if the iso is unable sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to needs therefore an increase in calls may be necessary to maintain system reliability because payment for is not subject to a maximum purchase price overall payments may be the extent the iso board resolution contemplates implementing that generators must bid their capacity into the iso any circumstances eg when system load exceeds mw requirement is not permitted by our order and the iso tariff future implementation of the iso board resolution with regard to to sell would require significant revisions to the rules such market changes could not become effective absent amendment to the iso tariff which would have to be section of the what do you think about wait here is what the sleeping bear commissioner said to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to proceeding to rescind our approval of the iso as the operator of grid the record supports such a move a memorandum iso from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine of the iso the memorandum also thoughtfully to the markets of a return to command and these allegations come from a nonmarket should we take heed we must also take notice of the on the board to compromise its brother amen odds and ends as you can imagine this week like an endless string of weeks has been interminable i get about three phone calls a day reporters very little of which ever sees print my shtick too complex for casual readers but i do notice that the asking better questions the public is becoming more savvy flow is moving in our favor and will disarm the forces in about have other problems on my mind i am working on a new really its just an upgrade of an older computer that is a than the laptop i tried to upgrade very unsuccessfully as of the all the new hardware and software i purchased my like a war zone with an odd mix of service copies and diskettes laying all around quite a for the future our next general meeting is scheduled and friday october and at moro bay barb a blurb for us in next weeks burrito about room golf etc our guest speakers will include frank who will talk on the subject of his choice of resource advocates who will make on the distributed generation case before the freddo of national energy group who will give us on operating a power plant inside the new england for your daily bread provided this week by dan last had a joke about catholics this week its atheist was taking a walk thru the woods admiring all that of evolution had created what majestic trees rivers what beautiful animals he said to he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the him as he turned to look he saw a foot grizzly towards him he ran as fast as he could up the path over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on tried to run even faster so scared that tears were coming to his heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even he tripped and fell on the ground he rolled over to pick and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill that instant he cried out oh my god and time stopped the the forest was silent the river even stopped flowing light shone upon the man and a voice out of the sky said my existence all these years teach others i dont exist and my creation to a cosmic accident and now do you expect me you out of this predicament am i to count you as a atheist ever so proud looked into the light and said it would hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all but could you make the bear a well said the voice and the light went out the river sounds of the forest continued and the bear brought both bowed his head and said lord i thank you for this i am about to and have a great weekend oh and thanks to all of you who happy birthday wishes it was very much
