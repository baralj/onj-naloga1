against dimples in by governor george w am disappointed with last nights ruling by the florida supreme court the justices have used the bench to change election usurp the authority of election officials we believe overreached writing laws is the duty of the legislature is the duty of the executive weeks after the presidential election a court has decided deadline for counting votes and certifying votes was not at all the court has decided that the selective recounting of have already been counted at least two times and in some cases three times will continue more than a week after the law says it should court has ordered that the secretary of state must accept all court had cloaked its ruling in legalistic language but make the court rewrote the law it changed the rules and it did so election was by james baker iii senior advisor mondays oral argument before the florida supreme harding asked a key question about of the florida supreme court and some democratic county have now decided to do just has no chance to win unless he changes the rules again to ballots so for the past week the gore campaign has been saying florida supreme court would be the final arbiter election but now that they didnt get a to their liking the gore campaign is saying that they will leave all their options open in response to inquiries about whether dimpled chads can as votes the florida supreme court cited the in illinois but the illinois case didnt talk chads at all it involved hanging chads that these three counties began using and that they are now seeking to change there has been a lot of talk about statutes in manual recounts in texas this would all be texas only allows one manual recount and it clear and objective standards the first of those you see light coming through and the second of where you have a hanging chad its only in the that the statute in texas speaks about of a dimpled chad and it doesnt say that chad can be considered standing alone it says be considered only where it also is accompanied by ascertainable intent of the voter to vote with its decision the florida supreme court has change the rules in the middle of the game the florida supreme

seven democrat justices the process by putting the this election in the hands of the six democrats and only one republican that control boards in the counties conducting in a transparent attempt to overturn the results of the gore campaign is now trying to rewrite in three counties that are still conducting statistical experts have said that under the gore will not get enough votes to lead so now the gore campaign is change those standards in the middle of the process the gore campaign wants to count ballots that have only indentation no hole in the ballot is single loose corner is necessary not even seeing through the ballot is necessary this has been proposed solely for democrats to votes to overturn the election ten years ago the democratic supervisor of elections beach county issued a guideline about how be counted that stated but a chad that is bearing only an indentation should not as a vote now democrats want to unfairly rules the gore campaign knows that the only way to get the need is to keep changing the rules this is unacceptable this election must be decided by that existed on election day not the by the gore campaign in a politically two weeks washington in the if gore ultimately loses in florida he will have very close to winning moreover he will have done his more or less intact for gore has sympathetic coverage from a largely democratic national press corps he has managed to spin radical unprecedented behavior as reasonable and legitimate this probably ensures that future elections will produce future gore off to the courts and the cameras with their lawyers and thugs demanding recounts rewriting the the laws convincing more and more americans that system is like those in most of the world rigged al we needed palm beach point
