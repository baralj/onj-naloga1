he rushed times for plus a td thomas jones on the other hand only had yards the panthers rank in rushing yards allowed per the last four weeks so you have to like his chances again this the year carolina ranks in fantasy points allowed to maurice smith rodney thomas vs miami the strongest criticism of smith you could offer is that time to rodney thomas smith was ineffective again last week score the cheap td he ran times for yards yards on carries and did bring a spark smith toe and even though its not believed to be serious its hard to faith in him with thomas coming on this week theyll face a thats been soft lately ranking in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to make sure to understand i dont have much faith of these guys so check the to see where i rank just that the dolphins have been very weak lately against the richard huntley vs arizona ran pretty well last week against a tough st louis defense so to count him out he posted yards on carries plus this week he gets a much softer defense in arizona that ran over last week the cardinals rank in rushing yards game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to anthony thomas vs detroit put in a very bearish workmanlike effort last week with yards carries clearly hes the kind of tough back this team he has the skills and speed to be more than just a grinder this likely see lots of action against the lions ranked in allowed per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to bays green vs minnesota green bounced back as expected and proved why hes one of the backs he rolled up yards on carries he did yarder thrown in there he did leave with some breathing problems is expected to be ok this week watch to make sure though hell face a viking team that looks like theyve rolled over rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four in fantasy points allowed to it doesnt always play out life but on paper it doesnt get much better than smith vs atlanta smith was weak rushes for yards and a but the dolphins dont seem too excited about going with so theres always that chance for a cheap td sort of like maurice smith i dont have much faith in him but this face the soft falcon defense thats ranked in rushing per game over the last four weeks and let the bills run wild on week for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to you have to like the check the to see we rank york jets curtis martin vs buffalo put in his typical workhorse effort sunday with yards on look for more of the same

another yard day times for yards plus of course just you mack owners nervous coach tom said this week that could see action this week or dont see it this week but with this season you never city ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to orleans ricky williams vs washington owners like me groaned when the saints fell behind so early williams was effectively taken out of the game hes been less and less a factor lately regardless of the ran for yards on carries and caught passes for thats pretty small this week hell face the redskins who rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to eddie george vs cleveland weird as it sounds eddie george will get the carries this week as skip hicks injured his hamstring and wont see action rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to terry allen vs tampa bay looked solid last week with yards on carries plus he showed little ill effects of being off and actually may from the rest this week hell face a resurging ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the last thats up from last week for the year they rank points allowed to shawn vs new york jets you know went wild last week rushing for yards on plus scores he also tacked on yards on did have a yard run which padded the stats a little but they henry will likely sit again giving another start the in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks year they rank in fantasy points allowed to york giants tiki barber ron vs philadelphia saw much action last week with barber rushing times for and only rushing times for yards and barber of course is more active in the passing game this face an eagle defense ranked in rushing yards allowed per the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy to vs seattle much for that rookie wall rushed times for last week clearly hes the primary focus of the offense has a bye in week thats not really fair is it so this is game drew brees could see some action which probably means be even more the focus if thats possible the rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to garrison hearst kevan barlow vs dallas had a solid but not great game last week with yards on kevan barlow carried the ball times for yards also caught passes hes creeping into time theyll face a cowboy defense ranked in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to bays mike vs baltimore tough to predict too much with these guys but mike was featured last week rushing for yards on carries score had rushes for yards and added receiving plus a td this week theyll face a baltimore bark is worse than its bite lately they rank in allowed per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to that just means that lately up a lot of yards the tampa backs have been very up and down so white vs tennessee white prompted lots of wheres he been comments from the last week as he rolled up yards on carries jackson out and ben gay still too unreliable it looks like the continue to utilize white hell face a tough defense this week that ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to smith vs san francisco is probably happy as he got a chance to pad his stats last week yards on carries he ran pretty well after a slow being totally and repeatedly shut down at the hes an average to below average back at this point in his career he like hell be able to hold off troy though the rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to dont discount smith is going for another yard season of course with at id give it to warren james stewart vs chicago stewart reinjured his troublesome ankle last week and in and played well rushing times for yards against tough team although he did get of those yards on the going isnt much easier this week against the bears who rank rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and points allowed to keep an eye out this week to see or warren will dominic rhodes vs st louis put together another excellent game last week against the jets yards on carries with score he also tacked on receptions he did have fumbles though this week hell face ram defense ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to it should be noted they let carolinas richard huntley run for and a td on them last week so its not like theyre michael vs green bay suffered last week from the same problem hes had most of the just didnt get enough carries to make a difference although one that after producing just yards on the carries he was given he didnt deserve any more a percentage guy thatll down for a while and then eventually break one long its just teams cant afford to wait as long it seems to be taking to this week hell face a packer team ranked in rushing per game over the last four weeks for the season they rank fantasy points allowed to duce vs new york giants has apparently forgotten how to run the ball lately but matter as hes clearly the eagles receiver last week times for yards but he caught passes for this week hell face the giants who rank in rushing per game over the last four weeks more importantly for rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to jerome chris vs cincinnati has upgraded to questionable for this week and play if hes healthy tough to say wholl get the call but one think that if he plays will be used just enough to keep the steelers are winning without him have a very beatable cincinnati this week and dont want to jeopardize their where they know theyll need plus the bengals is tougher than many think they rank in rushing per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank points allowed to alexander vs san diego looked to be making a statement that he should have been the along with yards on carries and a score plus another receiving with a td hell face the chargers this week that rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to stephen davis vs new orleans was held pretty much in check against the bears last week with on carries he did get the score though hes prime weapon here how much would you depend on tony banks he faces a saints defense thats been tough lately ranking inrushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to corey vs ran well against the raven rush defense as the in the week info been nothing special run lately they were ranked last week for and this rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four the numbers tell you more than the reputation this week steelers rep is backed up with the numbers ranks inrushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to this is a much than last week against the priest holmes tony richardson vs jacksonville had a on off day for him with only yards on carries yards receiving hell be fine tony richardson stole td a gamble as he wont likely get many yards even ona good day but hes a threat for a short td the jaguars have been ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to consider holmes a must start in most leagues but this is a charlie garner tyrone zack vs denver garner ran well when he ran but as has often been the case didnt run enough he had yards on just carries of those were between the zack and tyrone saw action making it nearly impossible to pick which one will the broncos rank in rushing yards allowed per game over four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed so itll be a touch do it for the rushing passing to analytics inc all rights reserved
