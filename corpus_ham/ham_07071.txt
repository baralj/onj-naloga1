good call guys i am not sure but i believe that i signed contract with you guys that double indemnified me from loss prior to me know when i can pickup my check for think if we had to recover our money from renaissance it would be difficult however the fact we charged it all on platinum amex and the insurance coverage the card provides for not received andor defective we should receive from amex of the money just like the letter said with was faxed to you by amex this am you did good dear however looks like eric lost all his money because he wrote us a check which is not covered too bad do you may not be able to repay millions of dollars in passenger deposits unlike most cruise lines it does not sail ships from us ports and so has not posted the customary million bond with the us maritime commission to protect cruise passengers
