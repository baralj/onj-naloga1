a friend of mine who is at his wits end trying to deal with the administration sent me this the best description of lee p brown that ive ever heard a doctor while suturing a laceration on the hand of a man asked his patient how he thought lee brown was doing as mayor the old man said ya know brown is a post turtle not knowing what the old man meant the doctor asked him what a post turtle was he said did you ever drive down a country road and come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top you know he didnt get there by himself he doesnt belong there he cant get anything done while hes up there and you just want to help the poor thing down thats a post turtle
