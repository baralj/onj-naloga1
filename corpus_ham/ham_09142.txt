enacts major wholesale will electric industry corp and southern company told by to charge prices instead of prices for wholesale spot item from the us federal energy regulatory commission voted last week to adopt new rules to measure market power as a condition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade power in the wholesale market commissioners said the new test would improve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the california market last winter when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test based on supply margin assessments which examines a importance in serving peak electricity loads if youre big enough to control the market at the time we look at it have mitigation put on you said chairman pat still reeling from new ruling which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend this is a mammoth ruling on part however and it holds tremendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lions share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions in addition state regulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrinking profits in their wholesale operations while has presented this ruling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experienced in the california market the new limits on wholesale transactions can also be seen as another example of the big stick that the commission is using to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizations further the ruling is another striking indication that chairman wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale markets while still attempting to support competition the objective represents a tall order and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prompt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale into a nutshell has ruled that some companies can no longer charge unregulated rates for spot market wholesale transactions instead companies identified as having market power and that arent part approved must charge prices for power that isnt committed in a contract and publicly disclose those prices been singled out as case studies on which will be immediately applying its new standards for wholesale transactions note that corp subsidiary of southern company has also been identified as having to submit information to in order to gauge its level of market power separate from its former parent the commission has essentially determined that these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in in which they operate under new market power test a generator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electricity is pivotal during peak demand which enables the company to demand a price above competitive levels regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a market power this is a dramatic departure from previous standards by which under one of main criterions a company that supplied less than percent of the power needed in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal are some important exceptions to the ruling first has not eliminated the utilities ability to charge rates in areas where the grid and markets are controlled by a this is significant as i will expand upon subsequently because it indicates that there are secondary objectives in new ruling in addition the current ruling only impacts sales transactions in which these three involved in other words contracts that the three have previously established or will establish in the future are not impacted by the ruling however the three companies named in the ruling to post pricing information related to contracts and has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for contracts may be necessary also note that the western market which already is under a price mitigation policy that imposed in june was not included in the new three utilities named in the ruling now have days to submit proposals to outlining a transition to charging wholesale rates power not currently committed to a buyer specifically the utilities will have to post on their information systems oasis the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a period moving forward the price that the utilities can charge for noncommitted power on the spot market will be the difference cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the their power displaces the new rates must be administered by an independent third new pricing standards revert back to an older technique known as split the savings the methodology for this standard can get but essentially under new ruling the three companies identified will have to post their incremental costs for spot power into the oasis system for viewing by potential purchases purchasers who want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not producing or buying the power on their own the final price for the transactions will be the split between the sellers incremental cost and the buyers decremental bid for instance if southern company bids its incremental cost and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at the transaction price would be assuming a trading day sellers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous day and buyers would submit their decremental bids by pm what this potentially creates is an information advantage for buyers who have six hours to evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers some of the drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post that may not be readily available and it potentially allows the purchaser to game the system by having access to the sellers original incremental bid and competing around the sellers also that in a separate development simultaneously opened a under section of the federal power act to apply the new policy to all us sellers nationwide what this means is that although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order it is expected that will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes to be erratic wholesale markets reportedly some companies are awaiting similar reviews by to determine if the commission believes they exert market power the investigation reportedly also requires with sales authority to amend their tariffs within days to provide with authority to order refunds if the commission determines that market manipulation has made a previous reference to the big stick that is carrying related to participation in remember that a few months ago chairman wood had threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an the benefits wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger applications advantages that the chairman equated with the new world of the deregulated energy market with this in mind note that only southern company and are included in the present ruling although it may be subsequently expanded southern company and in particular have exhibited some resistance in following consolidation mandate regarding national so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three utilities have been singled out this must be particularly painful for southern company which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading and previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets over the next five commissioner linda key represented the single dissenting vote in the ruling concern was that the ruling had together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evaluate the impact on wholesale markets this issue will undoubtedly be contested and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught and southern company all issued statements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which the ruling would impact them and that they were reserving the right for possible to summarize the commissions i think there are a handful of important points that should be considered first the ruling illustrates the steps that is taking to revoke authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that pat wood assumed his post as chairman second is implementing prices on market only and in only very defined circumstances however this could be an indication that the commission may extend pricing to other wholesale transactions including contracts at a later time third the split the savings formula could become fraught with its own problems its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market over power sellers which will now be required to post incremental costs in the bidding process finally one of the inherent drivers of new ruling is its desire to have large utilities join the that the commission has approved it is very significant that the new ruling immediately impacts and southern company utilities that have not only been deemed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have also not yet joined an approved however even though only three companies are immediately impacted by this ruling it should not be overlooked that the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now will gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas thus overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could substantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale are
