hi know many of you have early deadlines this week so i juggled my get these early heres how i see the rushing game this i rank players and to determine who to start i always asking me how i can have a guy ranked highly on the under a that favors the defense just because one be more favorable than another that doesnt necessarily mean id player with the best green may have a horrible week but unless youre sitting on ricky williams or marshall your guy no matter who hes lining up against the info to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding are provided by mike halls excellent league management are from get to maurice smith vs carolina was upstaged last week by big bob christian who looked great on the reception and run smith had yards on carries eye on his health as he was nicked in sundays game smith has been down but facing this carolina defense may be what he needs are ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the last and in fantasy points allowed to if youve been starting smith this could be the bays green vs detroit green was semi quiet running the ball against atlanta last times for yards hell face a soft defense against the lions detroit ranks in rushing yards allowed over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed to a sure starter vs arizona keeps talking about the rookie wall and just sunday he posted yards on carries plus a bad this week he faces the soft cardinal defense that ranks inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and for the fantasy points allowed to if been your guy start him again alexander vs kansas city continues to have a bulldog like hold on the starting mike is now softening his stance on ricky might be the down back when he returns but even to be a couple of weeks away alexander is the man hell face defense that ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over weeks alexander has to be licking his chops though at their in fantasy points allowed to the jason vs jacksonville did a nice job last week against cleveland carrying the ball for yards id expect him to improve each week as more comfortable in the role of he didnt catch any passes a little bit of a worry this week he faces a jacksonville did a pretty good against jerome last week they rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and in allowed to watch very closely how the team and self shannon handle the elvis interceptions lead to a more conservative with a focus on running the corey vs cleveland showed last week why he gets saddled with the carries for yards wont carry your team the is hes so hard to predict when hell break out this week he cleveland defense thats ranked in rushing yards allowed per the last weeks so youd have to think he has a chance the in fantasy points allowed to as anthony thomas vs minnesota didnt make much noise last week with just yards on fantasy owners are trying to decide who the real thomas week hell face a soft viking defense that ranks in rushing per game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed i think well see him get back on track the bear passing game open up some lanes for smith vs buffalo smith woes continue he showed glimpses of breaking out up with yards on carries im not as worried minor stealing too much from him as he only managed yards on this miami running game has faded quickly a soft buffalo defense this week that ranks in rushing per game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed tiki barber ron vs oakland looked very good monday while was awful barber rushed for yards plus he caught passes for yards on hand rushed times for a whopping minus negative raider defense isnt much ranking in rushing yards allowed per the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed to so this a good at least for barber id start at risk until he shows me orleans ricky williams vs new england ricky williams hes rolling yards on carries another receiving the reemergence of aaron brooks is a and ricky should keep it up new england ranks in allowed per game over the last weeks but i wouldnt let that at garrison hearst kevan barlow vs indianapolis continued the miracle story with another fine outing last week yards on carries plus he caught passes for yards he be too much for kevan barlow to overtake at this point barlow did carries but it looks pretty clear that hearst is the guy the ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to louis marshall vs tampa bay dont need me to tell you to start just do it and count that you own one of the best players in the michael vs san diego ran pretty hard last week gaining yards on carries yielded a td to thomas jones last week thats not good defense is definitely one that can be run on as they rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks they dont give points though as evidenced by their ranking for the year in allowed to the arizona offense was clicking last week detroit but its a little unclear as to exactly how richard huntley vs atlanta was much more involved this past week and showed his owners of life he rushed times for yards and also caught encouraging signs this week he faces a falcon defense be primed for a letdown after the big green bay win they rank rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and in allowed to smith vs denver actually looked pretty good last week returning from injury to yards on carries he was nicked late in the game so status this week but he looks like hell be ok for thursdays broncos rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last but are still pretty strong for the year ranking in fantasy to mike anderson vs dallas posted a whopping yards on carries against last week gary didnt do any better with yards on at this point youd have to say the entire is in disarray wr rod smiths injury is a huge factor as not the same with him less than this week they face a defense in dallas that ranks in rushing yards allowed per the last weeks for the year they rank in fantasy to being a short week will not help dominic rhodes vs san francisco rhodes didnt make anyone forget about james but he what we all were thinking being the for indy is not a he got the score and also rolled up yards on carries likely improve not bad for a guy who probably wasnt drafted league the defense is average ranking in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to priest holmes tony richardson vs seattle a bye week of rest holmes will see how he fares against the seattle ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over weeks and in fantasy points allowed to theyre but they do a nice job of shutting down travis henry and charlie garner tyrone vs new york giants including me hoped that charlie garner would take advantage opportunity with out to show he could be a full time didnt happen now is reportedly back and ready to go looks to keep running it between the while or punch it in at the garner still puts the yards sunday he rushed for yards and caught another the ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last showed last night they can be stephen davis vs philadelphia davis continues to roll up the yards last week he totaled on carries this week he faces a decent eagle ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed to tony banks will likely be back although kent graham did the travis henry larry centers vs miami henry looked pretty bad last week carries for yards isnt going to cut it for you throwing fumbles on top of put his playing time in jeopardy sammy morris and shawn at the bit dont forget about larry centers he had on passes sunday and those are likely valuable stats in the dolphin defense ranks in rushing yards allowed per the last weeks so itll be no james jackson ben gay vs cincinnati was a late scratch from sundays game and ben gay made the most opportunity you gotta love this guy hes a very hard runner raw displayed some nice talent im guessing gays play will be jackson could ever receive jackson is reportedly ready to cincinnati this week the bengals are pretty tough against the for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed smith vs new orleans struggled against the rams sunday night with yards on id expect tough going again this week against the saints in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and fantasy points allowed to new england seems to be coming back a bit and you know the tom drew thing has to be for the duce vs washington worries duce owners had about stealing up in smoke last week sorry looked like the duce of up yards on carries he threw in receptions for boot washington is surprisingly tough against the run ranking inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks it wont be but still you have to like with the way theyre playing jerome vs tennessee was held very much in check last week with the exception of one run even with the big run his totals of yards on carries werent much wont be much easier this week against a good that ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last the titans shut down corey last week who has a similar id have a hard time not starting though as hes focus of this offense and getting better as stewart for the james stewart warren corey vs green about a muddy situation last week warren corey each had at least carries and just for james stewart is reportedly ready to play this week throw in bonus that green bay is very tough and ranked in rushing per game over the last weeks thats enough to make me shy all these guys that and the fact charlie batch may throw it stacey mack vs baltimore we told our readers today the news isnt good for fred taylor his telling him to stay out of the lineup for this week and theyre too vague for my liking as to when hell be back that probably gets the call by default he posted a stellar yard on rushes day yes zero point elvis joseph can run back kicks but he yards on his carries and mark could miss the his leg injury all in all pretty ugly going against the fallen down to in rushing yards allowed per game over weeks but is still michael vs chicago got the carries monday night while doug chapman saw no had yards on carries so youd have to think hes right track back when moss and carter play like they its pretty clear the vikings wont need a lot from their hell face a much tougher opponent in chicago the bears rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and are playing for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to be a tough coming off a short bays mike vs st louis and put up pitiful numbers sunday had yards on had yards on carries although get a score granted it was against a tough chicago team but this week theyll face an injury riddled st louis team that ranks in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks even with i dont like either of these eddie george vs bad when the out rushes the but thats what happened george put up yards on carries and seemed to take back the trouble with him is that his game is so power when the holes arent there he simply cant do much this be much tougher against the swarming steeler defense ranked inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks they rank points allowed to im not one for benching your best this is one want to look at very do it for the rushing passing to analytics
