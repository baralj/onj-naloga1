radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis a concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly multicolored inspirational flags hang from the ceiling congratulating on its diversity and its values one more giant banner between energy company to the worlds leading a while that future seemed guaranteed as transformed itself from a stodgy troubled pipeline company in to a trading colossus in it was a wall street darling with a stock price that increased percent in that period with revenues that increased from billion to billion the very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to a report from global change associates a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy was largely the creation of jeff skilling a visionary determined to transform american business hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by ken lay skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground hauling it in pipelines and then selling it to refineries and other customers instead it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms from natural electricity from wind to water if you had a risky drilling venture would fund it for a piece of the action if you wanted your energy needs analyzed and streamlined could do the job if you were a third world country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs was there to build and build basically if an idea was new and wanted the first crack and with each success became ever more certain of its destiny the company would be the bridge between the old economy and the world and in february of this year skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded lay as chief executive officer says skilling was a great marriage of the mentality of the oil patch with the mentality of the financial story reflects the culture that drove american business at the end of the twentieth century like the companies it emulated going to reinvent the american business model and in turn the american economy maybe it was natural that this brave new world also produced a he best versus the mediocre the risk takers versus the who could see the future versus those who could not the key was investing right kind of intellectual capital with the best and the brightest couldnt possibly go could it today stock trades at around down from a high of in january the press cast as the archvillain of energy crisis last spring and skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face relentless defense of the free market a power plant project in india threatened the global ambitions telecommunications in which was heavily invested imploded wall street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices some of the change in fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of american business but the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape jeff skilling says had a totally different way of thinking about got it at in fact you either got it or you were color scheme of skillings river oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed here the living rooms white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets billowy sofas setoff the baby grand in the entry white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold white marling is no longer associated with having resigned abruptly after just six months as once skilling was hailed as the next jack welch general electrics masterful as one of worth magazines best in america anointed in and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which a friend told someone could actually get killed today he sounds more like ebenezer scrooge on christmas morning i had no idea what id let go of skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling a black chair in the white library across from a huge black and of his daughter and two sons skilling clarifies the demands of working for caused him to ignore his personal finances divorced he lived in a house without a microwave or a dishwasher he almost missed his brothers wedding learning a foreign never learned a foreign language he exclaims he never once took his youngest son to school im interested in the kids you dont do kids in out of it skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities then he stops and sighs im not fulfillment in life is compatible with a job he says finally then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains its pragmatic edge it would have been easy to stay he says but that would not have been good for a smallish man who keeps himself at fighting weight handsome in the way of corporate titans with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze but the impatience skilling once reserved for and utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation bizarre and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time his shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue and his matching blue eyes look im surprised he says that people have so much trouble understanding who passed through downtown houston in the late eighties or early nineties couldnt help but notice a funny and for its time novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the building from nine to five and before and after you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke they perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry puffing like mad they always and furtive even ashamed whatever people knew about in those days and most people didnt know much it was often associated with thin houston and there couldnt have been clearer evidence of its break energy world of the past what macho engineer would have put up with such this company was a child of another time that period in the when chaos enveloped the gas business federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady secure industry in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served into a volatile the situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business so it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company houston natural gas found itself under coastal corporation oscar less than gentlemanly firm was then run by lay a sturdy taciturn former economics professor and chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy his doctoral thesis at the university of houston was on supply and demand in the vietnam war lay who was from missouri and never least pipelines stretched from florida to california and throughout the state of fended off coastal but to protect the company from other takeover attempts lay nimbly engineered the sale of in to a friendly nebraska pipeline concern called one of the largest pipeline companies a way that would characterize the company for years to lot like coastal what the nebraskans blithely labeled the purchase was being called the merger back in houston and before long following some particularly brutal politicking between omaha and houston the center of gravity started shifting toward texas and shortly after that ken lay was running a new company called over time it became clear that lay had abetter vision of the future says one person associated with at that time he never fought change he embraced had won but what exactly did that mean was saddled with from the takeover attempt and thanks to deregulation no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines without new that matter a whole new business company could be finished before it really even got many people who teamed up with in the eighties jeff skilling had spent a lot of time in the midwest and he was fourteen he had been the chief production director at a startup tv station in aurora illinois his mother would drop him off there every day after school i liked being successful when i was working and i was smart he told earlier this year but unlike many of his colleagues skilling wasnt deliberate and and happy to go home at five oclock he was anxious and excitable and nothing but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call intellectual capital he loved being smart loved being surrounded by smart people he graduated from southern methodist university went into and liability took on harvard business school where he graduated in the top percent of his class then skilling took the next step on what was then the new business consultant and that is where ken lay found him in is often said of lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless and his choice of skilling probably saved the company skilling was an expert at markets and how they worked while everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses and so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by skilling came up with what the gas bank which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers would not be a broker but a banker it would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved and would make money on transactions much like an investment bank worked up some numbers and found them absolutely compelling then the consultant took the idea to a meeting of about executives he had a presentation almost to a person skilling says they thought it was stupid almost after skilling left the meeting dejected he walked ken lay to an elevator and apologized lay listened and then said lets gas bank was not an overnight success for months skilling woke up in acold sweat sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him in fact he had come upon one of different a huge breakthrough is the way skilling puts it today and even if he is typically immodest he was right fairly soon after launching the company sold million worth of gas in a week true to skillings joke around was that if a was under fifty we were as the head of finance corporation a new division created just for him in that company closed a deal that earned million in profit after that says skilling we never looked and lay also realized that the gas bank couldnt work unless it had a trading component myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go but by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it the company had the best contacts the best intelligence and the best access to supplies that in turn attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play with so many customers in its pocket could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans but with startling accuracy thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever change could never have occurred without another change skilling had mess the idea was to build a business which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by employees from the old days most were deliberate cautious responsible somewhat defensive people most of them men of kind of people youd expect to find working in regulated by the federal government but now the company needed of themselves and for the company was going a niche for itself or die one former executive explains the people who had narrow views eventually were forced out because if they had narrow views about other things they had narrow views about the wanted smart people but not just any smart people he wanted the smartest people from schools like harvard stanford and maybe rice and because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks like lynch or credit suisse first boston in addition to being smart people were also supposed to be aggressive you were right for if you didnt want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an could see what he was looking for on super saturdays at the houston company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just they were scored from to on their smarts their ability their passion for hard work and what at was called a sense of urgency people who scored less than were scratched the shrewdest he types that automatically turned down the first offer knowing would come back with more the starting salary was around maybe it wasnt a the signing bonus about was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown people didnt live in suburbs suburbs were uncool and too far from the the lucky winners offered the corporate equivalent of a program new associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals and there were rotations at offices around the globe the hours were long but every possible need was taken care of a company concierge handled all the things important people couldnt be house planning a vacation of course a lot of people who worked for never got to take were too busy making they could use the company gym and the personal trainers if they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking they could join wellness program massages were offered six days a week from seven in the morning until ten at night they were so cutting edge rhapsodizes someone involved company health care program at the time they really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people handed out titles analogous to those at wall street associates directors and managing everyone knew that those titles didnt really matter money did instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses offered competitive salaries and no cap if you really worked hard and delivered results you a lot of money says ken rice who stayed with for years until resigning recently as the head of the faltering broadband division or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a million him glacier hiking in patagonia land cruiser racing in australia or motorcycling in a recreation of the baja race ending at a spectacular mexican villa every time hed speak id believe everything hed say one loyalist why not by had become north americas largest merchant controlling percent of the market but at a company where the the gas bank model could easily be applied to the electricity committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers and untold profits for they began barnstorming the country pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents who with their salaries and monopoly service areas had little incentive to change and energy regulators who were somewhat more receptive thanks in part to generous lobbying the biggest winner of all was probably jeff skilling in ken lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company by then the division known as capital and trade resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity the division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees and revenues from billion to billion mr skillings experience so far with the the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track the new ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming up an idea machine is encouraging the entrepreneurs the new york times in in the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies corp is that elvis crowed fortune in wall street was demanding growth on a tech timetable and in obliged with second quarter earnings of million up percent from the previous year that year the company seemed to and even weather no one blinked when a london wine bar became an people drank more in warm weather than cold so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter most exciting to the financial world was entry into communications because of the marketing dominance became another overnight success handling billion in commodity trades online in as usual made its money on the spread between the bion trading excess capacity in large networks empty lanes on the fabled information highway wasnt that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines so created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth soon after it also announced a with blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to their homes looked like a company that couldnt lose its strategy of building businesses shedding hard assets and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market approach toward its customers the old notion of customer service was based on the long had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them but had new markets and new had to come to it over time the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them by creating owning and then abandoning a market before it and overregulated so if you wanted to launch a venture as new approach to drilling for got your financing from because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project if it ever would but because invented its markets and subsequently dominated them could set the terms of its deals from the to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at many businesses used what was known in the industry as accounting for instance used it on an unprecedented scale the company priced their deals at current market it was always of the market value companies that balked at their pricing didnt get deals and while companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years took most of its profit however many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years on the books in the current year if a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called subjective accounting investors didnt particularly care as long as the profits rolled in as the market fluctuated and the landscape changed the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins werent going to be high enough is known for leaving people at the altar says one former employee winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to attitude toward charity when a the houston read commission a literacy group called on for a contribution it was suggested that he start raising money for was supposed to make money for he became more and more successful the culture skilling had created ron family put it it became a company full of mercenaries the change started at the bottom as domination of the energy market grew most of the recruiting frills fell away new associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded global changes spies reported overhearing orders like i need a smart buy me one or buy me an intelligent slave quick had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday but now the workaholism bordered on disruptive people couldnt get their work of course had a program for institutionalizing creative tension the performance review committee which had initially been installed by skilling in the capital group became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country employees were rated on a scale of one to five and those with fives were usually gone within six months the nickname quickly became rank and yank it was a point of pride that skillings division replaced percent of its workforce every year as one skilling associate put it jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a skillings approach to in and get become attitude toward its workers in time it would become many workers attitude toward the company teamwork never that valuable in a trading culture went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus if protocol required an to come from europe to help with a project in the third might he might not depending on whether another potentially more lucrative project was pending were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future says one former employee anyone who couldnt close deals within a quarter was punished with bad scores as were the who had backed them past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in meetings that the phrase no old tapes became an clich people went from being geniuses to idiots overnight former such a hothouse paranoia flowered new contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the was monitored a former executive routinely carried two one for the company and one for himself people may have been rich at but they werent necessarily happy one recruiter described the culture bleed to jeff skilling could transform from the worlds leading energy ust as he had done ten years before skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order where once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets pipelines power may have been pride but skilling wanted them gone expensive building projects had no place when wall street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital and skilling knew it it wasnt the time for approaches an executive says of wall streets was the technology erato rid of the last vestiges of its past skilling had to take on rebecca mark long considered his rival for the job mark was for many was mark the came from sturdy midwestern stock but had the requisite harvard mark was largely responsible for the success of international the side of the company where she developed billion worth of gas and power plants which accounted for percent of profits in for this she reaped breathtaking executive estimated adoring press clips including two appearances on fortunes list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate then mark ran into trouble with a power plant in india one of the largest ever constructed she had played the game the instead of the usual and hung in through lawsuits and three changes in government but the time and expense needed to make india and other plants around the globe successful did not mesh with goals and skillings impatience with mark mark out however was no easy matter key executives left divisions were dismantled but she remained the truth was didnt mind firing employees but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive relentless people it tended to promote the company preferred a director in his cubicle say but failing to include him in the or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title one particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school gratis a company as smart as could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the businesswomen in the country would provoke a her own company despite skillings contempt for businesses spent more than billion to buy a british water utility that could serve as entry into the emerging world of water privatization mark was put in charge of making yes the worlds greatest water company as the new business was called looked like mark had to succeed on increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities water is not like gas or and governments are a lot less willing to up even for lots of money the company stumbled layoffs commenced and confidence evaporated by august the stock price which had started out at had fallen to marks resignation followed and was folded into i think its best for rebecca to lay who had been a mentor to mark told the wall street as one critic put it they were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a drew to a close skilling was in total command in december ken the company is doing well he told the press is doing now in february jeff skilling took over the immediately the trouble started domination of the market made it an instant target in the california deregulation debacle both and the new york times took on portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in washington lay and political action committee are the top contributors to george w bush to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity skilling and lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market while another memorable scene juxtaposed one traders against a hapless state employee in california as both tried to buy power online the times reported that lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy pounding for its omnipotence wall street was discovering its weaknesses by late march the stock price had slid to a share from the divisions took the rap for the decline the india plant continued to be enormously costly at least in part because of constant turnover within management team but the california situation was more visible and therefore more damaging despite claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had for three months gray davis did avery good job of blaming us says mark palmer a vice president for corporate communications we were a texas company there was a texan in the white house california was a state that didnt put him in office and his biggest contributor was a texas energy company performance is going to take care of our stock price the truth will take care of gray davis california utilities still owe million another reason stockholders panicky but more problematic than the crisis itself was skillings all too apparent lack of contrition facing down his critics he cracked a joke comparing california with the titanic at least the titanic went down with its lights the biggest problem was telecommunications division which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price that could revolutionize communications just had revolutionized gas and power estimated the global market and selling space over cable would grow from billion in to billion by then the tech bubble burst so too did the deal with blockbuster for the first time in its confoundingly successful life had nothing new to take to market like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few suddenly looked less alluring to wall launched a campaign to keep most important cheerleaders the stock analysts in the tent but he wasnt cut out to be a supplicant during the reporting of first quarter profits he called an analyst who challenged financial reporting an asshole when the company reported hefty second quarter profits many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets ignoring the growing chorus critical of accounting skilling promised as he always had that innovations were just around the corner there wasnt any positive news carol of prudential financial says now basically he talked me out of a business press so generous in the past turned surly fortune had asked in march whether was overpriced start with a pretty of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale skilling had sold million worth ken lay and ken rice close to four times that amount then the wall street journal reported on a fund run by the that had been a source of strife within the company it was essentially risk management against possible failures every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in unforgiving finally got a taste of its own medicine when wall street is in love with a stock theyre forgiving of something like accounting says carol when a company falls out of favor all these issues carry more fact was not lost on people inside the company who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience those who had looked the other way as the most powerful executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways it just created an attitude one executive still at senior people are doing that why are we held to a higher standard there was a real culture of were above everyone had never been prized at so there was no reason to expect an company like exxon could demand hardship duty in baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road but houston oilman explains if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesnt have loyalty and has money then you have a corporation thats better suited for good times than it turned out that description applied to jeff skilling too as the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend he made no secret of his frustration then after a trip to visit the families of three was over ever stoic ken lay returned to the office named a new president arranged a trip to new york to calm analysts and investors and promised a kinder gentler in the future trading anything and everything was out the company lay says will still innovate but innovate review committee i think we could have applied better by trying to categorize people into so many different categories you ended up creating a morale skillings supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament lack of emotional intelligence despite skillings lengthy tenure with hed always been contemptuous of the long haul hed always believed in cutting losses and moving on but now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble it was different even biggest detractors wouldnt have wanted him to walk out the door one loyalist on the day we meet skilling is looking forward not back look he says with finality ninety percent of my net worth is in were my interests aligned with the shareholders of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas his eyes flash as he talks about new technologies the first wave never gets it right he says the didnt work but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world houston he promises will become the worlds center of commodity trading and he intends to be a part of it in fact he is already shopping for office is the second wave and got it he says almost breathless there are thousands of people running around the streets of houston that get it
