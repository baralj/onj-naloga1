their passing sea free agent updated coach mike has named brock the starter for this against the broncos relegating to the seattle bench the player of the week two weeks ago but it obviously to keep the starting kc eric bass updated injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the bills injury wont likely keep him from playing this week against well see wednesday or thursday said head coach but from what the doctors told me i think the for him to dt den hunter updated ray will miss at least four games with a the injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter was chasing down chargers jeff graham spencer will take over position until he smith free agent updated looks likely to get the start when the bengals play scott mitchell who started sundays game against new england as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game smith is starting doesnt mean you should do the same he needs in gear before hell have any fantasy davis den eric bass updated will undergo another this week on his injured leg and is having in san francisco crosscheck the results at this point the preparing for this weeks game against seattle as if davis if you have davis backup mike anderson it seems like a to include him in your starting lineup this martin updated status of the jets running back for this weeks game against the still uncertain martin left sundays game in miami with what as a strained back and never returned to the field he had by team doctors yesterday and had some taken as club hasnt released any information on the of the exam is on your fantasy squad your best bet is to stay tuned as the coles wr hunter updated to new york coles will be unable to play in this against the bears he was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff second half in sundays win over the dolphins if coles is an of your roster look to pick up ward who should get more in coles joe no free agent updated saints resigned yesterday after the veteran had by the team during training camp with jeff blake out for the season needed a no quarterback so will fill that role aaron brooks and backup jake blake no eric bass updated saints placed blake on injured reserve yesterday officially ending he will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is will be replaced by aaron smith mia fear updated

chargers smith has been one of the fantasy sleepers and has become an everyday starter for owners who were lucky enough to grab him if he does in fact week be sure to include him in your starting mia mckay neal updated his status is still up in the air expects that he will to play in sundays showdown against the colts on the first play of the jets game when linebacker mo lewis head and shoulder into the turf he suffered a slightly shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back fielder isnt the better options in the fantasy game so avoid playing him this if he does johnson was updated redskins should know by thursday if johnson can reassume his for this weeks showdown against the eagles he has started to test left knee with some light and will likely push the during practice on wednesday and wr free agent updated the injury to ike will likely start this at arizona with only receptions on the entire season a solid fantasy option so dont pick him up unless your roster for
