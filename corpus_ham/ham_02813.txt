did a friend forward this to you get on the bush change links are at statement from secretary james a baker statement from karen numbers democrats urge gore to quit legal unsound and legally from secretary james a baker american people voted on november governor george won states with a total of electoral votes in florida was very close but when it was bush was the three days later the vote in florida has been of the state election supervisors recount are the end of this recount governor bush is still the only to counting the overseas ballots which favored the republican candidate no evidence fraud either in the original vote or in the recount the gore campaign is calling for yet another recount and predominantly democratic counties where unexplained large vote swings in their favor in appears that the gore campaign is attempting to the national presidential election challenges to the results of the vote here in the more often ballots are recounted hand the more likely it is that human errors like and other risks will be introduced this very reason why we have moved from hand counting me say a word specifically about the palm beach is a rule of law to be followed for elections the florida has established legal procedures to design and if need be to protest ballots before the ballot was designed by a democratic elections approved it the democratic party did not question the election this ballot was used elections in the same county under the same rules democrats did not complain the overwhelming majority who used the ballot understood it and cast valid lawyers have confirmed the legality of this ballot and copies of the relevant florida statute available for seethe gore campaign has also tried to make a lot of the fact marked ballots are not counted a key principle is one person one vote if we have ballots with of course we cannot count them or guess about that are cant be evidence of the to vote one way or another no jurisdiction in states would accept such a ballot as a valid vote law specifically does not it happens in must be understand and i understand personally that it to lose by a narrow margin but it happens to the republican presidential candidates in both vice president nixon and president ford put interest first they accepted the vote for the the is important that there be some finality to the what if we insisted on recounts in other states very close for example in wisconsin iowa and if win new the country step back a moment pause and think at stake this may be the last chance there is end to this process if it slips purpose of our national election is to establish government not unending legal wrangling therefore vigorously oppose the gore campaigns efforts recounting until it likes the result for the good of and the sake of our standing in the world should end and the business of an should vote count on tuesday night showed governor bush election and a recount has now confirmed his only votes left to be counted are the overseas which in the past have favored republican dole carried the overseas ballots in florida in by of to percent even though he lost the election we hope vice president gore and his campaign their threats of lawsuits or still more could undermine the constitutional process of selecting and has no foreseeable beach post capital florida county tries to fill in blanks on beach urge gore to quit legal john b a louisiana democrat questioned campaigns wisdom in challenging the palm beach right thing mr said is to count the votes the decision without lengthy litigation and g democrat of new jersey warned mired in the want al gore to win the election mr but more than that i want somebody to win there is going to have to be a very compelling anybody to take this into a court of unsound and legally problem is that potential remedies such as a new palm beach county seem politically unsound and the sad reality is that ballot disputes are a feature of every election it will political atmosphere if presidential elections come to be seen as merely a starting point say yes to counting a little more but the legal which mr spoke elliptically should be enormous caution and restraint absent more than known our sense is that either a lawsuit or a would raise at least as many questions as it would the courts in the end cant legitimize the folks are even calling for a rerun of the it is important to decide this election by the million americans understood or should when they entered the voting booth tuesday not just about fair play for al gore and george w bush about defending a system that regards verdicts final word a concept that distinguishes this nation others in the know i dont think the ballot was a problem bill tell you that theres one section i dont know are really looking at which relates to electronic voting and in that particular case law says down here it says voting squares may be front of or in back of the names of candidates you start saying the ballot should be thrown out confusion i think that cases like that could be brought allover the for by change
