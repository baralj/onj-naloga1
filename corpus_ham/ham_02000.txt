hi crunch time so lets jump right into our upgraded and as we head down the home stretch identifying those players or down can be the difference the playoffs or the sidelines as we head into our week of listing these inevitable that some guys will have made both the upgrade or make sure you understand what talking about is players moving in other words a player like te ricky dudley could appear downgrade list and still be good enough to be a starter in your just means concerned about the way he seems to be heading player like wr willie jackson may make the upgrade list even though fairly far down the list of all about which are moving keeping an eye on these trends as they can very all the and downgrades some of these players are obvious moves up and some arent as clear heres my list of guys i see moving moving aaron brooks no we keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering outstanding game sunday where he rolled up yards and as he for the saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it will continue to air the ball out yes hell make some young and id be surprised if he didnt throw as many interceptions as i expect him to throw a lot of both i almost started him manning in my local league but didnt pull the trigger manning but brooks was stewart pit made our upgrade list last week and sits again it took a few years but hes showing folks that maybe no fluke he showed guts coming back in the game after being with a bad knee or calf depending on whether you listen to coach or stewart the td rush was highlight material his problem seems to have been confidence and hes surely brimming with it graham was so bad i wont even mention him in the downgrades but he a horrid display when he was in the game hes jay mia dan said on monday night football a few that a nice pass just thrown by was as pretty as anything ever threw has those moments and he was having them against the supposedly tough bills where they were supposedly going an advantage in their cold weather didnt play out that looks pretty darn jeff sf we had him high in week like we have all year didnt disappoint wr was a huge help and rices on the radio had some sort of positive effect chargers had been very tough against the pass and shredded brett i have a hard time putting a finger on it but this does what it takes to get the job done hed be much better off if wr freeman earned of his paycheck but in the meantime doing a great jeff george was danny removed the primary obstacle his jeff george off the field by firing turner looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the tying to anything past the next series is a stretch im george fan though and he does give the team a big arm well see goes but at least it looks as if hell get his moving mike anderson den like you need me to tell you this the fact ran buck wild on a tough new orleans defense made the effort all impressive he bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks good for sunday clearly the denver ol is the star on this team so own anderson its probably not a bad idea to grab for fred taylor for all the ive done to taylor hes just as we predicted he would lately like a madman you dont me to tell you hes been tb can the little guy take up the slack for ive got a couple hundred reasons that says yes ok against dallas is nothing special its happened in of games this year but you have to admit looked great corey one can only salivate about what he might do if for a team like denver the fact he can continue to roll up on this team is amazing new scott mitchell is a huge boost looks like peyton manning back there compared to green greens a guy thats finally living up to his you always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to catching up mentally as well he showed a nice nose for the with the smith mia so much for the cold weather hamstring carried the load sunday in frigid buffalo and looked great it me like hes picking up right where he left fletcher sd its not exactly the same as earning the job in tennessee or indianapolis but fletcher does seem to have the slot in san diego and thats worth something you have how fred sf we loved early in the season as he racked he got back in the mix sunday with carries and a td the fb for has always been a valuable ff slot and might be worth of the dice if youre thin at shawn finally does something besides make me for hyping him he rolled up yards on just attempts sunday to take advantage of sammy morris ankle terry allen no allen made an appearance sunday and with jerald chad morton failing to astound anyone allen could get more hes got anything left in the tank remains to be moving david boston boston turned in a huge game sunday and has to be an upgrade hes a streaky guy but with frank sanders a total factor boston is getting most of jake attention these and with arizona almost certain to be playing from behind he could some darrell jackson sea jackson was red hot several weeks ago but of late he warmed up again sunday with jon under tough to depend on the passing game but jackson could be curtis sd has benefited the most from the leaf he caught passes sunday and should benefit as leaf willie jackson no officially moved past the flash in stage with another solid day aaron brooks continues to look good jackson may suffer a bit when jake reed gets healthy but for right looking joe horn no again aaron brooks delivers and horn is the prime joe horn is one of the better stories of and he should to shine especially if the rushing game doesnt get bobby shaw pit shaw may still be available in your league as wr opposite ward he found the again and make some noise with stewart sf the best news for jeff owners had to be day from hes a huge boost to the offense when he and it looked like hed made progress with the toe keep an eye out he responds after the game but i liked what i davis ne ok ill be honest im pretty much just here because hes the owner of the coolest name in the moving dwayne den finally starting to emerge as the te in denver his yards sunday were second only to san jones you have to worry about clark stealing time but no trouble starting each reggie kelly one of the few bright spots for atlanta has been of kelly he caught passes for yards sunday with a td new johnson may lean on him as he settles mark pit makes the list not only for having game but for making one of the best td runs after the catch sunday piggy backed a defender into the after refusing to go down at yard andrew glover no obviously the play of aaron brooks raises the play for all the saints receivers glover made a couple of nice including a good looking td moving moving shane chi take a seat shane cade likely makes his folks can hardly troy dal smith owners had to love it but did it to anyone else that the cowboys felt the best way to come back huge deficit against tampa was to feed the ball to clearly has zero faith in ability to throw the king tb i know hes had trouble with the back but passing thats a joke hell be better but ive seen brad johnson was its the jeff george show at least bad for a few rob johnson in leagues that penalize for interceptions youd better off starting yourself this weekend than you once again he starts the game but finishes holding a anderson not playing too badly but the team shambles after chris chandler was benched anderson vented some saying for all he knew he might be punting this week i think well see that but i also dont think well see the days of rushing the ball for the rest of the alexander sea ricky has proven to be less than playmate refusing to share the ball actually hes played so mike has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow star when the team is struggling as badly as it is you dont the one thing thats forget about them this team will live and die by sd evidently is the choice fletcher now thats gotta moving joe this has nothing to do with the play of hes been very solid but you have to think ike will be a he returns hes no lock to go this week but he may be terrance continues to struggle on a team thats tailspin new doug johnson seemed to like throwing to shawn jefferson could spell more bad things for small charles johnson phi forget about it donovan be a solid without james wayne dal these guys just arent troy is a mere shadow of his former robinson chi back troubles were apparently than many had expected it was announced monday that hell the rest of the season with a bulging disk in his back it appears get by without surgery but hes certainly not looking moving pollard ken ind neither of these guys did this offense clearly isnt in the same groove it was earlier jackie harris david dal more bad news associated with neither of these guys were much value sunday and i dont see very pete mitchell one of the bigger disappointments at te this just cant get
