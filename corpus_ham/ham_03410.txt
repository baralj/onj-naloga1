hi scott takes a look at this weeks aaron brooks brooks and the saints offense are clicking now fantasy owners must be ecstatic brooks has scored in of the last weeks and i expect this trend to continue remainder of the season with an easier schedule and better brooks has been able to connect with aaron brooks willie breakout tight end boo jeff continues to put up exceptional numbers he for or more touchdowns in of the last games i wouldnt in favor of any quarterback in the league right now he is a charlie batch yard touchdown performance however i still think batch will see bench time as the backup mike some playing time towards the end of the season winless lions a tough schedule remains for batch and the lions bay chicago tampa bay and are left on the rich a strong performance on sunday with yards and proves and the raiders offense is the team to beat in with tim brown and jerry rice looking fantastic will post good numbers for the remainder of the kurt warner warner looked good on sunday night with yards and more importantly he did not appear to be hampered by a that has been nagging him throughout the season as always in your starting jake plummer plummer looked good on sunday with passing yards touchdowns keep in mind this performance was against the hapless for plummer to return to his normal erratic self in the next two san diego and oakland plummer might be a good option for as he faces dallas in week and carolina in week alexander plain and simple alexander produces when he is lineup he scored his touchdown of the season on sunday and yards once again look for alexander to remain the starter returns from duce continues to look better and better the yards on sunday will be a sign of things to come for in half of the season offense and a rock solid keep the eagles in the lead in the majority of games with in trouble with a team suspension due to marijuana lose many carries to managed just yards rushing against a solid but a catch yard receiving performance helps vault him upgrades section more importantly it appears that has after being hampered by foot and hamstring garrison hearst hearst nearly reached the plateau he has looked good the last few weeks and should continue this the remainder of the season the offense continues to look a favorable schedule gives hearst the advantage over a majority running backs in the ricky williams the saints offense is looking sharp and brooks making wise decisions the offense will continue to get this will lead to more scoring opportunities for williams williams the yard mark in consecutive weeks look for this trend as the saints have a favorable schedule in the second half of marty booker the bears finally starting passing the ball bookers statistics were directly affected he burned the long touchdowns on the day and made it look rather easy look longer passes out of the bears in the second half of the season starting to sell out to the run booker and miller should connect play action pass joe horn horn remains one of the hottest receivers in the league catches for yards on sunday with aaron brooks making the new orleans offense has started putting touchdowns on although this may be bad news for john carney owners it is for horn ricky williams and willie jerry rice with tim brown receiving the majority of attention rice will continue to be effective on the other side of the career touchdown leader added more to his total on sunday and made rather easy with the oakland offense looking good rice to see scoring chances a good option for a wide receiver peerless price with catches and yards receiving on continues to outperform eric moulds in the bills offense and have owners questioning who is the number one receiver in buffalo moulds being shut down with double teams price has quietly scored on the season price is a talented receiver and should score a touchdown every other ward ward has amassed catches in his last games he scored two touchdowns on the season but his reception and are becoming a consistent factor on a weekly basis ive never big fan of the steelers passing game but ward deserves consideration duty on a weekly david boston bostons game streak ended this week had to settle for yards receiving and touchdowns look to continue to put up quality brian the ankle injury to rod smith had me worried a heading into sundays game so i was not surprised by on sunday with smith hobbled by injuries and out year receiving options were limited and his production affected you may want to consider benching until smith however the broncos do play dallas on tim couch couch threw interceptions and was held to against a stingy ravens defense couch should be considered a quarterback but the browns schedule will make couch an for the remainder of this season couch should do well and jacksonville but struggle against new england green bay mark an injured quad injury kept out of the week with an unfavorable against baltimore this week it maybe best to start someone else this elvis looked horrible with interceptions on week was not a total disappointment for as he threw the schedule looks favorable for but he is struggling tony banks banks suffered a concussion in sundays game the injury looked severe as banks was slammed to the ground taken off the field on a jay threw interceptions and touchdowns on two touchdowns were scored by the jets up and down season for continues with games against and san francisco left on the schedule should still a quality spot eddie george george was held to yards on carries sunday yet to break the barrier in a game this season i guess injury in the preseason affected his performance more than although we can blame the toe injury two other factors the demise of george this season first the loss of lead neal has minimized running lanes finally the titans is not giving george the quality run blocking of the previous anthony thomas thomas was held under yards for the game with opposing defenses focusing on stopping the will continue to find the running room a little tougher remainder of the season keep in mind the bears last two bay and tampa bay are two of the better defenses against the run league with tampa bay green bay minnesota and detroit on for the remainder of the season expect thomas stats to be up smith with rushing yards on carries smith continues this marks the consecutive game that smith has been held dont be surprised if the dolphins give travis minor a in the running travis henry henry continues to struggle he managed just carries this past sunday and had a crucial fumble a running back cannot be productive with just carries keep him on your rod smith suffering from an ankle injury smith was limited to on three catches he did manage to score a touchdown smiths deserved your attention the broncos kept smith on the in the quarter while the team was attempting to drive down and tie the ball game the short week will not help smiths status eric moulds the disappointing season for moulds continues he to yards on sunday while peerless price gained on the other the field moulds may not even be the best fantasy option on the this wayne a shoulder injury to limited his production and the passing game isnt looking very good at you may want to bench until he is todd has become a regular on the downgrade i like the guy and think he could become special however he do what is on a consistent muhammad muhammad suffered a sprained shoulder and was play in the second half against san francisco heck his production missed its pretty difficult to miss little to no production if what i mean if youre a muhammad owner you know what i reggie wayne wayne suffered a sprained knee on sunday and his not yet known he has yet to do anything special this season but were fairly high so ill downgrade in mind the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of and alex van pelt van pelt stepped in the lineup and looked good with passing yards and two touchdowns he has a crew with moulds price and as long as he can get his production could be a welcome addition to fantasy teams of a ben gay gay was the feature back on sunday with carries for and a touchdown against a quality baltimore ravens defense no back has taken over the reigns of the browns rushing offense just be that amos although he suffered a sprained shoulder against is expected to return to the team this week if you have jerome on your team deserves spot if not you may want to take a flyer on this guy have a solid running game and an injury to would open for to produce quality jordan jordan is in a similar situation as if gets injured jordan would enter the lineup and produce not a bad option if you can spare a roster spot if you martin get stokes stokes looked good on sunday with yards and a marks the second consecutive game with yards with the good in the passing game a healthy stokes could be a decent keith was unable to do anything on sunday against however he continues to learn the offense and should very shortly effectiveness will most likely occur with rod smith garnering teams on the opposite side of boo williams boo has me excited about his potential hes a tight end with good hands plain and simple he has big play should produce in the saints analytics inc all rights reserved
