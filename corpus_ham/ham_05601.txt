guys i just typed a small novel below about and thought i out its a question a friend asked about how the stuff works and has an example at the question about what makes the bad guys run away during army paid a of cash to make laser tag stuff for called miles and if you ever see a picture of an army unit on you will see that the soldier is wearing a harness over his bearing the harness has four receptors on the front and the back in addition there is a doughnut shaped belt of receptors on the helmet vehicles also have receptors mounted to thing from to the tanks to the weapons systems have transmitters on them itll look like a little on the front of the weapon the box has a pressure sensor so the gas from a blank round firing hits it it fires a laser beam downrange if the laser beam strikes a receptor the guys harness will emit awful high pitched whine that lets everyone know he is and dragons bazooka like weapons are simulated by called vipers same weight same size except it fires a big that will be strong enough to activate an enemy tanks miles vehicles miles game is pretty neat there are two types of kills on a mobility kill and a critical kill if the viper or other have a solid hit on a sensor in a critical area a mobility result which means the explosion just blew the of the vehicle radios and weapons still work a critical kill means the vehicle inside are dead dead dead if a tank gets a critical kill the will actually shut the vehicle down and kill its radios the guy be along and then he will hear over his radio a females critical kill and the only thing that will work on the vehicle are the direct fire weapons systems are pretty easy to replicate target wears shooter fires a fire weapons though are a bit more difficult whereas before always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a on target artillery often shoots targets that no one directly are two ways around this at the national training center they do all the armor against armor training they have the miles you have an armored motorized rifle sitting at i have an observer away who with optics can see my fo calls in a fire mission based on the target description a bn be fired rounds fired in volleys as there are only tubes in abn the like referees will monitor for fire from the observer to the tubes and the will take the data and plug it into their big miles computer which will take any errors the observer may have made and any errors the instead of artillery companies we have artillery batteries may have made when the gun batteries tell the observer that pulled the trigger the who are always listening will pull trigger what happens then is a satellite hovering above down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area rounds would take up it will do this times to simulate all landing any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed where the light fighters ie no armor assets organic to to play we dont get no satellites what we do there a fire mission is called to the guns the will monitor it and data in their computers the computer will take into account any by the fo and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate this be passed to a fire marker which is a crazy guy with a four gps and a god gun a hand held transmitter that fires a universal ie men to tanks and aircraft i say crazy because these guys who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target average response time is minutes which is about then it would be in real life so its not as cool as miles see these guys ass through the woods on theses to get to their target grids on time and god help you if he pulls your position and no you cant haul ass if you see one your your oc who is with your unit will zap you on the spot if you from a fire marker ill close this bad boy with a shit there i was all good war stories gotta start with had started the first phase of the rotation entry into the box is the engagement area at the previous night and our way km sw hand railing a road identifying eliminating the observers over watching them it was the and we were dead tired and had finally reached our which was a road intersection in a semi wooded area just to of the main air field that the rest of the brigade combat team gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets there was a berm area just off the road basically the dirt walls were yard long we moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause time it looked like it would be super easy to defend which was we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath plus our combat observer laser team mounted on a with to guide copperheads and hellfire missiles basically and bradley support vehicles had just discovered boom a minefield at the intersection this was happening as we were occupying the we detached a small element to go the casualties from the and a couple of joes min later the and his nailed by antipersonnel mines surrounding the mine field while aid the wounded inside the vehicles at the same time a civilian two redneck females showed up like they were to on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm the vehicle at they employ real civilian actors to on the battlefield or cobs because in real life there are we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at time so we got the and a couple of guys down at the obstacle truck right outside the berm when the co decides to go check on by this time we had been in this big berm read trp point or the enemy probably has his guns laid on for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough a mission off for like minutes when sure enough off in the hear this getting steadily louder and louder we were so were basically denying the obvious theres no way hes headed for god dont let him be headed for us basically you had an in a yard radius which is about the same size as a area so there we are listening to this wheeler get closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on ready to haul ass of course we cant legally run until the first so this guys comes down the road shoots off the road smack dab into the middle of the berm jumps off his bike and with air burst arty simulators basically a little flare gun sticks of tnt up ft into the air to simulate incoming simulators would pose a hazard to troops basically what this is that we were setup the baddies were just for us cause were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment so joker is poppin off airburst tnt after the first burst i and got up and hauled ass luckily i was close to the exit out fast because between airbursts the fire marker was left to right with the god gun as guys were to i got out of the berm and just kept a good because and i know what the burst radius is on these suckers i and saw the infantry guys at a tree just outside the there were no visible real life ground bursts they thought they as i was at them to keep an oc came out and just all guys as the rest of the people who made it out were about of us and we were all now north of the all over hell little bunches of guys to trees just as the last of the living made it out of the berm we vehicle come tearing the trees about to our left and ground sure enough its a read basically a cal ona truck bed so there this fucker is lighting us up from the enemy mortar fire our tail ends since the was payoff tgt i was immediately on my net holy shit we got here grid at the same time we got to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their to get two vipers together we were told by the that the theyve ever seen kill vehicle here with was two vipers fired at section of the vehicle at exactly the same time but the viper scattered all over hell all this happened within about co had seen us come the berm and heard the light he was on his net to the scout helicopters but so were pinned down trying to suppress this truck while laser blasts since its just miles a blade of grass can deflect finally the show up actually they got there only minutes chase the bastard down and smash him with with of guys dead and one down we were ready a little rest and then start the mortar and other supposed to be in the we got the shit ambushed us it was really a pretty on the enemies part we were stupid enough to setup in an feature one that was no doubt on the target lists so mortar rounds started and we started pouring out of the the cal was to mow down whoever didnt get killed by thats one of my stories and subsequently one of the ive ever written so im gonna forward it to the rest of the its about time to go get my drink on talk to i thought consultants had a lotta when you guys these exercises what makes someone high tail out of an i know youre not firing live rounds at one another so they simulate real life scenarios also in concerns with deer be headed down to junction our lease to pull a trophy this probably freeze my ass off but ive had my deer picked out information
