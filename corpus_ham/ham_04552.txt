couple of quick notes before we get to this upgrades and surgery today to seek another opinion according to the that jim will likely not go outside the team for a back and jerald moore will likely be the choices with morton getting a little undersized at and but so is charlie garner and he manages pretty came from time program at and averaged carries a game last year so like he used to carrying the load and he may practice this week even if he doesnt practice he may be able to play and keep his record streak of smith benched not just benched benched for scott mitchell gotta raring to go with out for the year with wrist marshall has reportedly told the coaches he may be play this week most think too optimistic but nice to desire george to to the redskins jeff george will start this week at coach turner has stated the starting job when possibly lets jump right into our upgraded and downgraded players as we head home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines head into our week of listing these players inevitable players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list make understand what talking about is players that are moving words a player like te chad lewis could appear on the downgrade still be good enough to be a starter in your league it just means about the way he seems to be heading likewise a player like coles may make the upgrade list even though still fairly the list of all about which direction players are moving an eye on these trends can very often make all the and downgrades some of these players are obvious moves up and some arent as clear heres my list of guys i see moving moving mark one of those guys who quickly points has never put together fantasy numbers to warrant the hype he but you deny what has done lately behind a standing in there while taking a beating and delivering jimmy smith made a roaring comeback and paired with one of the better wr tandems in the league kerry collins a few weeks ago i took some deserved lumps early praise of collins but kicking his game up a notch of late more comfortable in the pocket especially in his footwork and watch to see how amani is doing but when healthy ike make a great wr corps ground game in ron barber continue to help the passing donovan phi with deuce gone had to offense and this week he came through with flying colors the bad he only completed of his passes sunday the good news is he threw times when a airs it out times in one game it bode well for the chances of winning but certainly for your ff team to see that many attempts with that many chances like allowing yourself to double the stats a jeff blake week or jeff attempts puts up unless you have a feeling about stanley or think continue to throw trent bal remember this list is relative while he may a starter is definitely moving up the charts and is all about he actually looked very good at times in the over tennessee sunday he showed nice poise coming back after throwing the game away a few plays earlier brian with a marginally talented tony banks in and might do it here again with they play dallas and cleveland keep in mind baltimore has a bye on december troy dal when bashing mark as a fantasy compare him to troy great real but not a much notice a pattern here after being named the starter went out and lit up the bengal defense which was ranked over weeks hard to put too much faith in him but if for a he could be worth a gamble tough this week but he gets the vikings in week jeff blake no you of course know by now that ricky williams is for weeks i hate it for williams owners one but done all we can do now is look forward and looking forward i being forced to carry an increased load donovan threw times sunday in the wake of losing deuce and i see a similar type situation in new orleans with blake throwing a rob johnson i make it a point to hold my tongue on but gotta say i think mr charisma with the spiffy is wrong in going to johnson in terms of hands down the worst in the in my opinion but none really matters as rob johnson has to make the upgrade list since named the starter for this week get too excited finishes roughly half the games he starts and the next three kansas city tampa bay and miami could be brutal matt played nicely replacing remember there was even some talk about trading and this summer when elbow was a big concern before you up the farm to snare you should know brett feeling better and hoping to play this week keep shane cade chi again highlighting guys moving with the injury to jim miller shane will be thrust into role the injury will also likely add a little fire under who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have been was performing well looked very rusty but tough a when thrust into the game like that look for least for this week against a tough tampa bay defense and then moving smith mia you have to keep giving this guy his props great game although if got an owner salivating over you can get a lot in return it might be a great time to trade him imagine his value being any higher his yard per carry number in game and he faces the jets this week plus a brutal against tampa bay in week james ind tough to upgrade a guy already near the he put in another great game sunday with total yards and shows sign of slowing down he averaged yards per carry sunday colts are leaning heavily on him watch out for a tough november vs miami robert smith min smith quietly is having an incredible year those hang nail injury jokes way behind him as become one of in the league running between the tackles for the and catching the ball exceptionally well keep an eye on that against the cowboys fred taylor jaguar fans may be distraught but fred taylor to be happy at least lately running as well as he has in career even if his team is struggling one can only wonder what with a healthy supporting cast got two tough weeks and tennessee but as everyone knows taylor has a run of opponents in weeks when he faces cleveland arizona anderson if you know better you might have were watching tape from if you saw anderson sunday he ran hard the power and quickness that pushed him to stardom hopefully able to maintain that michael nursing a chest rib injury so keep on that but assuming ok he has to make the upgrade list a td sunday and averaged yards per carry on carries he receptions his main competition for carries thomas jones had justin watson watson held his own sunday as he rushed for on carries he likely be a factor long as marshall itching to get back on the field but he might be worth a shot more green with troubles green clearly shoots charts an enormously talented but got to learn how that talent into on the field production after a tough tampa last sunday he faces a soft schedule with the colts panthers and minnesota coming chad morton no with ricky williams out for the next weeks guy to attempt to fill his shoes is the rookie from detroit wr johnnie little brother and was reportedly to ricky williams and shaken with his injury small but not as big as probably like but neither is last year at he carried a full load as the featured rusher capable the team announced their plans yet and bringing in agent is a possibility but expect morton to get a shot has a fairly favorable rushing schedule ahead with oakland francisco and atlanta all moving james dal wow what else can you say but give the man catches for yards with a td is a pretty good day and troy can keep it rolling is the question but you have to done thus far got a brutal next week in he might be worth grabbing to play against the vikings in week sean sea excuse us for not getting excited about a guy buried on the a few weeks ago and had jon throwing but looking better and responded with a great the question is whether he can keep it up but of the holt i drew a few snickers a month ago when i said derrick mason was the best wr on the titans just about ready holt the best wr in st louis and no knock on really coming into his own and to be honest benefits the attention isaac bruce draws he does face a couple of in washington and new orleans but betting he manages to tough derrick mason ten mason is clearly the best wr on the team partly as kevin gone and carl is injured but just that good the titans had their running game shut baltimore sunday and they were forced to the air and much to of many steve fared pretty well and mason was a big that ricky great just what fantasy need another worry about caught passes for yards and a td sunday in missing marshall as high powered as the rams room for another wr at the patrick johnson bal johnson replaced travis taylor in the lineup up big with the game winning td he only caught passes that the receiver behind te shannon and wr still though a brian team and trent is with each series it jimmy smith with catches for yards i guess you can back the jags may be struggling but smith and mark in synch ride it while the combo is jerome ind terrence had a firm grasp on the wr in the season but seems to be taking over there with more confidence and more importantly seems to have of peyton manning he had catches for yards moving bubba franks for a long while franks and te tyrone davis for time now looking like franks has prevailed as davis very little time franks made a great catch of the fake kick td showing some of the athleticism that caught the eye in the rod ne so much for eric seems to be te threat for the patriots and you know drew likes to throw te if he can just get that thumb shannon bal after some quiet weeks has returned place of one of the premier in the game clearly the on the team and has the confidence of trent just he seems to have confidence in moving trent green mike said a couple of weeks ago he felt green behind center was like having kurt in we if going to deal him the time even as well as playing the league warner does not lose his job to a broken team is talking about december as a possible date be back but heard even sooner regardless you have to figure his days plus upcoming games against washington and new orleans in two weeks could pose a doug right or wrong takes a seat as rob named the starter this week hold onto him though as got the chances of johnson staying healthy for long are drew ne so much for the boston bill that would miss several weeks still though you see he with the brett as you know suffered a sprained foot while everyone was shouting about how many weeks miss anyone listen today that he looked to be ready for this against indianapolis players are notoriously optimistic so keep on elvis kc get me wrong is still a top he sunday human he really should have done more against though on a side note he say shave that goofy they brian den the quarter of the monday night game as this and pretty obvious brian is at less than keep an eye on this a gutsy kid and has played through but it does seem to be affecting his charlie batch game another less than batch just seems to struggle to get anything smith been ripping this guy for weeks and now i feel bad for him as been scott mitchell gotta jim miller chi talk about blowing an opportunity miller had the bears and looked to be the spark chicago was missing with and then mr achilles decided he want to participate and too bad as he was showing moving down charlie garner sf been a regular on the upgrade list and another huge game sunday where he posted total yards with a the chiefs two big days loom on the horizon though i be shut out in week has a bye and then he faces new orleans in week and a great player and one of in the game but be facing some tough coming ricky williams no as i reported yesterday to our email williams suffered a broken ankle and will miss weeks i had watching saints head coach jim talk about how ricky defense and make any of those sacks or force any fumbles how just one guy and be fine good jim but in for a rude awakening if you really i think he does chad morton will be the likely moore will get a shot car yards per carry will not get it done featured in this league and exactly what got to get back on track if the panthers are to be a mike tb it seems as if is less of a factor every he only had rushing attempts sunday for yards if i were pay to tell the coaches i needed some smith dal what a disappointing game vs the bengals fumbled early on what should have been a sure td and never seemed i thought carry the load for a struggling turned other way alexander sea so much for the idea of coach mike in the towel for and starting the young players like the rookie is a fine player and will get his time but for seem to be happening anytime broke his wrist sunday and will miss of the season i have no idea how the rams will function moving marvin harrison ind is it just me or is marvin harrison getting more quiet with each game he only had catches for yards seem to be a big factor still one of the best but worried about his terry glenn ne faded down the stretch and the help his play one bit be too down on him as he some favorable on the horizon but if for robinson chi the loss of jim miller is huge the bears with their and you can only expect so much robinson will better but only so much he can antonio freeman freeman appears to be headed toward the path on a few weeks ago mediocrity and that was with a healthy than it could be green tb gain is loss as seems locked in on johnson green will still catch the occasional but it appears for now the clear cut terrence ind suddenly terrence is the forgotten the colts passing game for some reason peyton manning just him the moving kyle still a solid te but with the return of clear that he be the big target he had jay was a total non factor in only pass for yards one has to think the shuffle could an sea yielded his starting te job to christian seems fairly intent on keeping it may be a contributor looks like he see enough action to make him a consistent
