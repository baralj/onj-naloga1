good original message hi this came from my sister inlaw and thought id pass the info on this is what she sent i learned a computer trick today thats really ingenious in its simplicity as you may know a worm virus gets into your computer it heads straight for your email address book and sends itself to everyone thus infecting all your friends and associates this trick wont keep the virus from getting into your computer but it will stop it from using your address book to spread further and it will alert you to the fact that the worm has gotten into your system contact or new person just as you would do if you were adding a new friend to your list of email addresses in the window where you your friends first name type in thats an exclamation mark followed by zeros in the window below where it prompts you to enter the new email address type in worm alert then complete everything by clicking add enter ok etc placed at the top of your address book as entry this will be worm will start in an effort to send itself to all your friends but when it tries to send itself to it will be undeliverable because of the phony email address you entered worm alert if attempt fails which it will because of the phony address the worm further and your friends will not be infected be delivered you will be notified of this in your hence if you ever get an email telling you that an email worm alert could not be delivered you know right away that you have the worm virus in your system you can then take steps to get rid of it pretty slick huh its worth a try if everybody you know does this then you need not ever worry about opening email from friends pass this on to all your friends rsvp himself
