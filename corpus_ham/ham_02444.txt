image image discussion among ut brown who covers ut football for the dallas morning your questions about the bowl picture uts quarterback next years potential stars and more inside ut football to chip brown talk about the colleges received several responses to an email from a reader last week uniforms and whether the longhorns should change them here are some responses of your recent respondents indicated that ut needed to alter their i just wanted to go on record as thinking they are the uniforms in the country i admit to being biased but love nonbusy look of the uniforms i also have no problem color of the burnt orange as the person suggested the white the simple yet very distinguished longhorn emblem is as pronounced star on the dallas cowboys helmet while i agree with him about shoes i think any changes to individualize or otherwise look would be a move in the wrong direction rick i was interested in john comments about the ut uniforms ut in the i have seen the changes in the uniforms come and go think the best uniforms were in the season perhaps a national championship these were burnt orange jerseys name on back and texas on the front with the plain white orange stockings the white uniform still had the orange stockings jersey was white you may remember that fred brought pants ala and added the texas to the i like the jersey but think the return of the orange add something to both uniforms but particularly the road white memory when darrell royal was questioned about the plainness of his response was that these are work clothes and not intended fancy i agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes long way i recall there was an orange single stripe in addition to in the early but it didnt add much keep up the good enjoy your newsletter tom ignore all that guff about the longhorns uniforms i think they are sharpest anywhere if we change the helmets then we look like a team what that guy needs to remember for away games is that we and white period so what if it doesnt have too much color i stay exactly the same remember when tennessee changed their uniforms orange pants they looked like a bunch of ice cream men on the q sandy face either oregon state or oregon it will be oregon state if dont get a berth it will be oregon if the beavers do get a if beats kansas state look for the wildcats to go to the nebraska would go to the alamo bowl iowa state would go to bowl texas go to the independence bowl in shreveport former coach jackie and mississippi state and texas tech to the bowl that he would be less inclined to redshirt although one could he might like the opportunity to showcase for more than one year he finally got the chance to show what he can do without getting five passes a redshirt seems like a reach if he doesnt best guess for texas in i know that you get asked this but with the new development following the it seems that we fresh in this kyle the landscape for my best guess is will get the start for game and well be back in the same situation we were heading into major knee injury this time to his right knee ut coaches a reason to go with not only now but heading into and next fall mack brown said on monday that he wouldnt rule out again but one would have to think after the sluggish start suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would to do that again despite breaking nearly every passing record didnt look as sharp as he has in the past during his before getting injured would seem to have everything going the coaches finally saw what they were hoping to see from season now that theyve seen it you would have to think that they start getting more experience for the guy who will lead them the next not stick with a guy who only has one season left im not fair but it seems like it might be the way the ut coaches but we wont know how the situation for will shake out fall most three receivers every down and teams would have their hands full do johnson and sloan thomas will see more playing time from now they just blossom during the otherwise why havent they seen certainly argue that ut should use more sets next one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the longhorns will at those positions there is sentiment on the ut coaching staff that position was pretty average this season so the coaches will take look at will this spring at fb at and he has he is also quick with good hands if doesnt add to the fb position it could be argued that ut should try to use sets and get its wr talent on the field but well see ut a nice job of adjusting this season to a set realized they were overwhelming their young receivers with too and too many quarterbacks now that the receivers can more of the playbook look for ut to be as multiple and complex as possible next season johnson finished the year as the receiver so he saw the field plenty sloan thomas was the had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver be ready to fill in at any of them so he was slowed by the and then had to fight for playing time with flowers is a senior so hell be gone next year flowers worried about his playing time with thomas redshirting or bart routes in practice are redshirt freshman tony jeffery and the son of denver broncos coach mike will really help the team a lot next year jeffery is and trying up from pounds is and trying to bulk up from but both have shown great hands in practice the first two names off of mack browns lips when asked about players to watch in and spring practice were redshirt freshman lbs austin thomas with texas losing four linebackers after next season and tyrone jones brown said some will have to play a bunch in to be ready to become starters in two inexperienced we never seemed to be able to run up the this year who would you figure has the best shot at being bruiser what role will our fullbacks play russell loaded next season i know the line loses tackles leonard cory but and mike williams should be able to take tackle nicely mack brown also said that redshirt freshman ot lionel lost about pounds from to and looks good so with a should continue to improve the longhorns just need a back who can it brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as gets ready to finish his eligibility coaches want victor ike and ivan williams to toughen up and grow up coaches have told that sneezy and possibly cedric benson will get a shot because those three all had a shot this year and failed to thomas artie next frank and more than pounds he is a bit undersized but could add his speed would give texas the tight are trying to establish with bo scaife it may be a longshot but opening kickoff and the kickoff and ut got the wind at in the quarter how did this happen and if the toss the aggies choose to defer give ut the ball at both kickoffs and the wind in the and m its back giving texas the ball into the wind in the first quarter then got the choice of the ball or the wind in the third took the ball into the lost at least two games last year due to problems on special teams the longhorns would have been and possibly on their way to a had it not been for a blocked punt that was run back for a stanford with money apparently not being a factor i really do why brown doesnt break down and hire some specialized help don all the special teams duties among his assistant lewis making the tackle team weve had some great players in the past like robert brewer brown whose performances may have been surpassed by contributions i think were losing a lot of leadership this casey and mitchell leave of the returning players it look like will step up as team leaders next keith to take over as leaders after losing casey rogers brown on offense ut will look to its quarterback its young linemen such as of for steve and leonard davis but the one that may be missed the most is he kicked several field goals two years ago and nothing but continue to break records since he has been an he has been so automatic on field goals he has also done job of punting this season matt a redshirt handle the kicking duties next year and at punter redshirt smith will compete with a junior college transfer who has committed longhorns for next year that will be a huge question mark for texas next magic id have to take in a close one isnt he has that winning magic that would be great for a conservative the andrew the world season has to lead his team to victory and impressive numbers if he has any hope of winning the the almost due and chris is gaining lucius navy california and indiana any of which could help the the road at tournament time the longhorns suffered a blowout loss in the semifinals of the preseason nit but coach rick was prove a point to his team about being intimidated as of tuesday with antonio had three freshmen in the starting lineup point guard royal small forward brandon mouton and center james brian has gotten increased minutes at forward has been a force and transfer maurice evans is leading scorer and is starting to hit a better percentage from the mens team doesnt have another test until dec when the at south florida other games worth watching or getting tickets home games against illinois dec and utah dec the has also gotten off to a nice start with its only against the team is relying on several freshman forwards stacy and hastings the team relying heavily on sophomore tai so both teams are young of if you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to find or change your password modify your account or comments suggestions c
