hi this into parts tonight so its not such a huge email ill passing game in this one and the rushing game good luck this to avoid and game heres how i see the this week exactly where i rank to determine who to start one may be more favorable than another that mean id start the player with the best the is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by info the fantasy points allowed by position numbers are orleans passing game vs raider defense gut check time for the they deal with life after ricky most folks know big on is just one of those words for depending on your knows that need a decent passing game to be effective on beginning to think however that the effect quite in reverse in other words i believe losing will hurt much as losing jeff blake would have williams with chad morton the backfield for blake to air it out against a suspect raider pass like donovan is doing in philadelphia over the last oakland ranks in passing yards allowed per game for the rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing wr by far the favored target while keith willie a few te andrew worth a shot if in a bind but very passing game vs defense the defense squashed elvis owners last week but not quite ready to appoint them been awful for the year up until then over the last four weeks rank in passing yards allowed per game and they rank for in fantasy points allowed to the opposing chris among us now and the cobwebs seem to be cleared wr by far the best receiving choice although worth noting that a great game against this team back in week that seem like a long time ago te reggie be worth a shot as the rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing kelly has done very little of passing game vs panther defense running out of describe the stellar play of and i think rolling this week against a carolina team that ranks in allowed per game over the last four weeks creates problems i think the panthers can solve of course throwing to the best wr tandem in the game and that never hurts both moss and cris sure starters in any league both have chance every week of exploding even consider wr matthew in the gambling mood in a very large league the much of a factor here and when they are the receptions are passing game vs ram defense jeff another start of the injured brad johnson after a less than earth shaking in week vs arizona yards td he gets to face a st louis pass defense still giving of yards even with bud carson helping out they rank in allowed per game over the last four weeks and for the year they in fantasy points allowed to the opposing as much as the like to control the game with davis you just have to be forced to throw in order to keep pace with the rams should help things wr albert been the source of for many fantasy but this should be a good week for him covering the wr job and he might be a good roll of as well te stephen seem to produce the think he would in this offense partly because fb larry short passes that might have gone to the passing game vs viking defense looking for a this one call it a hunch as he does have some his way with injuries to his supporting cast iffy fb william out and center frank to his eye and offensive lineman matt campbell thigh were injured during the new orleans loss coach george both can go sunday on the plus side got two physical hayes and muhammad that could give the vulnerable viking he should have more time to throw this week against a only recorded sacks in the last games for the ranks in passing yards allowed per game the te still shaking itself out as kris looks to be healthy only certain is no one has really stepped in to fill the wesley walls bay passing game vs colts defense first off this assumes brett get healthy if he can i like the against a colt seems to play just good enough to win for the year they rank yards allowed per game it should be noted played though ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the weeks indy seems to jump out early and force the other team to which they often come close to doing struggled his and his own health but this could be a game he surprises of a guy and this would be a great chapter in the book see the start but he must get his fumbling wr antonio a likely starter in your league although like he produced like many thought he would bill the wr and he often sees more passes thrown his way freeman bubba coming on at te and could be a nice passing game vs chief defense most folks know not a big rob but got a good this week against a kc defense awful defending the pass over the last four weeks they rank yards allowed per game for the year they rank in fantasy allowed to the opposing although a chance de eric be back this week after missing time with a bad knee and that will pass rush he practice wednesday though johnson will to one of the games best in eric moulds not only is talented but he draws by far the most targets on his team great for kids but you like for your fantasy to be ball hogs jeremy up the scraps sammy so watch that as a solid receiver as well te jay a real disappointment lately although the chiefs are awful against they rank just in fantasy points allowed to the opposing te passing game vs jets defense i know if this will be like they had in their earlier this season but the for the dolphins to score some points is definitely there rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four jay have plenty of options available as the dolphins getting healthy leslie well but tony now in the mix the least physical of the bunch but got a pretty good shepherd here even though he may not start with martin healthy success of smith is carrying this offense so look much through the air for miami bay passing game vs bear defense to continue against a bear team that know which way headed the decent defending the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per the last four weeks but for the year they rank in fantasy to the opposing playing with confidence and will focusing on getting the ball to johnson something from sporting dan this week about probably know receivers have to wear numbers in the as a jet all the were taken so they allowed him to have it a hit with the fans and properties that even when in the came available the league granted johnson an keep it is a cool number for a wr ill admit this week johnson continue to have success against a suspect bear secondary really dropped off with new found attraction for going near in that sentence catching the ball and te dave a steady passing game vs cardinal defense offense is with injuries all around the trouble is these guys to start with now hurt too what this means is that the could see lots of offensive action this week if the cardinals anything when they have the ball arizona ranks over the last in passing yards allowed per game but that number will probably if donovan throwing the ball times a game as he philadelphia may be struggling to find a running game but up for it through the air aeneas williams is a tough cornerback cover everyone charles of action stanley the ball very well and thinking te chad break out of his slump passing game vs packer defense green been pretty late ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last but for the year they come in at in fantasy points allowed opposing peyton a guy go wild for you in column but i like this the packers have a couple players either hobbled or out and manning should have time to dangerous the majority of manning and just the way we like it jerome taken the job away from terrence both solid and feel ok starting either in leagues one of course a huge asset catching the of the england passing game vs bengal defense the bengals are playing new coach dick but their pass defense and secondary is porous over the last four weeks they rank in passing per game although for the year they rank in fantasy to the opposing this week the health of drew is on mind he says play and is calling it see troy hobbled onto the field last week and bengal team up if healthy he could do even better and troy brown are the prime guys with glenn still the main showed an upswing last week after a few worrisome games he just nice contract so see if he can start earning it te eric quickly he was starting a few weeks ago and now unemployed is the new te and would be a great pickup if available passes last week including a passing game vs jaguar defense hard to get too the ball but this is a decent jacksonville ranks in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks they rank in fantasy points allowed to the last week they let seattle roll up the yards and jon is manning ward the new starting and be interesting to see if benching st round any difference truthfully reaching if down for these guys though jerome the only on this offense unless in a really big york jets passing game vs dolphin defense after the indy loss coach al was giving votes of confidence to vinny usually not a good sign but remember the last time these vinny went wild with yards passing and miami from that meltdown and has only allowed in the last dolphins boast two of the best corners in the game in sam madison madison can shut anyone down and wayne hands full although he had a great game in the first the wr but i like the rookie do some here worth a shot maybe if strapped for miami faith in that they often leave them on the island in which can lead to a big play te anthony showing flashes like green bubba franks it took a little while big guys city passing game vs bill defense guessing out of the chute firing the chiefs desperately need this clear to see that winging the football gives this team chance of winning the bills play a solid pass defense ranking yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and ranking points allowed to the opposing for the year te tony the focal point of the offense although the bills rank league in fantasy points allowed to the opposing te for the year sylvester a solid tandem and a nice job receiving out of the backfield although you what coach gunther will do with his diego passing game vs bronco defense remember that the this denver team so anything can happen this time of year i fair amount of email from owners with great have to like peyton manning or great poor mike got to decide between jim said ready to go and is calling his injury a he was named the starter early in the week but with management style now starting leaf not sure it te freddie the only viable starter on that team but darn good ranking in my td performance league over the weeks denver ranks just in in fantasy points allowed to te for the year so he could do some damage here both to him so it really matter who gets the nod jeff too inconsistent to get excited about passing game vs saints defense both these teams took a beating week with the raiders losing a heartbreaker to denver and the their star ricky a broken ankle the saints have been pretty weak on pass defense lately ranking in allowed per game they are better for the year where they rank fantasy points allowed to the opposing be interesting will be scrambling and improvising as usual wr tim primary target but james andre see some action up and down but te ricky have a chance as ranks in fantasy points allowed to the opposing te for tyrone looking very questionable for this week sprained ankles which will probably force to throw louis passing game vs redskin defense we see it every year it so many teams fail to heed the wisdom of acquiring a solid backup real teams and fantasy teams need one to be successful is getting antsy on the sidelines so you know trent for another game or two before turning the keys to the car back no mistake green wants to win for the rams but he knows a contract green will be a starter somewhere in and with his negotiating power is strengthened he should fare well even is a tough defense partly due to the loss of green will likely be forced to the air often as if he needs to made a bit of noise about returning for this he did practice some thursday even if he does play hard to him as a real factor the trouble with st louis is picking the will score each week isaac the two but ricky not bad options either and for good measure te roland been effective featuring sanders champ bailey and darrell green are unit but have their hands full with st passing game vs cowboy defense dallas shut down the bengal game last week now something to be proud this face a rejuvenated baltimore passing game flying high doing a great tony banks impression as coach breathes life into another troubled career his primary target shannon i think that will change for this week ranks in fantasy points allowed to the opposing te so he up for opposing dallas ranks in fantasy points allowed for the year patrick decent plays against a secondary that will be without enforcer george teague gone for the year that will be as a leader on the though as poor as the defense has been have to think the ravens will focus on ball with held the packers to yards passing last week shane for the bears seen shane play and no not even a matt the bears are in shambles buffalo and losing another starting to injury gary is rumored to be headed to young and sad to see him talk about going in fact some wish about and just go this could get ugly for it should be noted the have a tougher reputation than would support over the last four weeks they rank just yards allowed per game they rank in in fantasy points the opposing for year solid numbers but not quite as dominating would have you believe still though shy away from the bears this week maybe roll the dice on a wr but sketchy at best in fact seemed to lock eddie week instead of robinson when he was thrust whether this is a real tendency remains to be seen but to bank on any of these guys too heavily this passing game vs giant defense i have never liked charlie think it stems from the fact he looks like otis but bottom never been comfortable with the guy getting less comfortable each week it seems sunday batch faces a tough giants defense cb jason back they rank over the past four weeks yards allowed per game and cb dave thomas are both who give up very little physically to johnnie morton moore seems to be finally waking up likely face thomas not nearly as good as te david a shot as the in fantasy points allowed to the opposing te for the year but eye on him as questionable hamstring york giant passing game vs lion defense detroit may be struggling the ball but doing a pretty good job defending the in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks kerry need some healthy receivers to do good to go but both amani joe gibberish on the sidelines sunday after suffering concussions likely to play but you have to wonder how effective be are much more vulnerable against the run so conceivable could go with heavy doses of ron some tiki in for this one francisco passing game vs falcon defense still a huge jeff but not too high on this vs the falcons especially with less likely to play as the week progresses news is that jerry to be ok for sunday atlanta ranks passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so the secondary ranks in the league with interceptions as tough for the year though where they rank in fantasy points to the opposing atlanta has sacks in the last games getting decent pressure on the the key as i see it will the running game with charlie garner having a great and receiving the passing game vs titan defense the worst thing that could to the browns was for the ravens to spoil the at home last week betting you see a fired up defense this could spell doom for doug the browns tennessee in fantasy points allowed to the opposing for the year painful to watch and it be any prettier this week kevin dennis see most of the work but have a feeling very good about starting either in fact you can pretty skip the cleveland team this passing game vs patriot defense i doubt still in fantasy football in week if you have many bengals on your may have his faults but the master at confusing a get ugly on the flip side always that shred of returns to his form and lights it up but i doubt of corey wr peter the only other possible on offense always worth a roll of the dice just play potential passing game vs eagle defense this is almost unfair are already one of the worst teams in the league now they hamstring is worse than it was last week when it was bad sanders has a serious knee bruise michael ribs him and thomas jones has walking pneumonia good grief goes to jail and has their wife leave them be a unless desperate avoid all the cardinals this just about any team much less the eagles who are playing defense right passing game vs steeler defense the above three offenses cincinnati and arizona make the list are awful the jags are struggling with injuries still but here because the steelers are playing excellent defense in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks in fantasy points allowed to the opposing for the year it was against the steelers when mark was benched martin back in week will throw to wr jimmy smith but not looking for a lot from either guy the game at night and a long ways from jacksonville both and more importantly temperature te kyle has calmed jimmy smith is back healthy although a decent play against passing game defense troy will find the this week against a fired up raven team than he did against the last week baltimore ranks for the year in fantasy to the opposing over the last four games they rate yards allowed per game will look for james tucker man that sounds weird but expect the same success last week from these guys in case you were wondering baltimore is ranked in fantasy points allowed to the opposing te for the jackie harris and david look good passing game defense one of the cornerstone fantasy football is you have to understand that the numbers rule to look at the browns and dismiss them as awful but in certain as pass defense very good in the numbers department cleveland ranks in fantasy points allowed to the opposing the last four games they rank in passing yards allowed per reasons for doing so are different but putting up pass very similar to what the ravens are posting in are choosing to run the ball against their vulnerable rush risk a pass when the defense is begging to be run over steve be looking to derrick mason and chris sanders carl could play but been burned enough by these te frank is still the primary receiver although the ball around a little passing game vs charger defense after a few weeks of flailing the chargers are back at the top of the defensive rankings over four weeks they rank in passing yards allowed per game where miami seattle and oakland granted not like shutting down louis but holding those teams to an average of yards passing per strong be facing new gus likely take a get settled ed and rod smith are both solid using the te set with clark dwayne and byron all producing i like all the broncos and i can see in many leagues just not too happy about the
