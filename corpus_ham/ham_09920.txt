as a material adverse effect have been the focus of much attention among merger professionals this year due in part to the stock markets fluctuations and the economic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are considered extremely difficult to prove both parties typically are reluctant to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal much the way a bride and groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views that a buyer cant easily walk away from a merger in that case concern foods inc sought to cancel a planned acquisition of inc due to a drop in earnings and

details about circumstances under which deals can be terminated since the sept attacks for example a handful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity would qualify as a

of business would qualify as a material event the liability must result from litigation currently the company faces more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty and directors issuing false and misleading reports and other makers who arent involved in the combination say the steep drop in stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldnt by itself give the ability to cancel the pact or force to renegotiate its terms instead they say would likely have to prove that worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event which could be difficult in light of the

not alone heres what companies should doby and david mike in an age when giant earnings writeoffs have become commonplace its shock wall street but on nov corp managed to do it after years of growth that had seen earnings surge by up to a year the energy company acknowledged that results for the past three years were actually overstated by more than a dollars confirmation of investors worst fears three weeks earlier a big drop in shareholders equity sparking fears that its hideously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance management pointed to a number of factors including a dubious decision to exclude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and error several years earlier that had inflated the may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far short of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases but it is hardly alone this year corporate america is expected to charge off a record billion much of it for assets investments and arent worth as much as management thought chart page even if companies dont go back and restate earnings as is doing those charges cast doubt on the earnings growth of the late since the has the quality of corporate earnings been such an so difficult for investors to determine theres more at stake than the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers if even the most sophisticated financial minds cant figure out what a company actually earns that has implications far beyond us financial markets have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build it has made the us the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place to invest it has also ensured ready access to capital for us corporations that a company such as a member of the standard index and one of the largest companies on the new york stock exchange could fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnished the profession of auditing and accounting is in fact in crisis says paul a former chairman of the federal reserve and now one of the leaders of the international accounting standards as in the case of fuzzy numbers result from questionable decisions in figuring net earnings more often though the earnings chaos results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in their own idiosyncratic an increasing willingness among investors and analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies which appear under a variety of names from pro forma to core offers its own such version before investors untangled the importance of first announcement its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its recurring net income had met expectations the resulting murk makes it difficult to why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place because the numbers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a prospects many institutional investors most wall street even many accountants say is irrelevant i dont know anyone who uses net income anymore for anything says brothers inc accounting expert robert the problem is that includes a lot of noncash charges and onetime expenses while investors need to be aware of those charges they also need a number that pertains solely to the performance of ongoing what operating earnings are supposed to do but because theyre calculated in an ad hoc manner with each company free to use its own rules comparisons between companies have become meaningless no not any ordinary read these in a way thats useful l chairman of the securities exchange commission the sec is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income in the end investors need two standardized operating number and an audited a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other out of hand a widespread consensus is building to do just that in early november sp proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when tallying operating earnings only the week before the financial accounting standards board the for had announced that they too would be taking up this issue says the international accounting standards board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating the past two or three years the use of creative earnings measures has grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out says david m sps chief investment strategist earnings are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when theyre trying a company if people want to use an measure we better all know what were looking those standards in place the gap between earnings according to generally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to wall only going to grow wider and more confusing look at the variance in according to wall street analysts as tallied by according to sp and according to numbers reported to the sec under sp like is owned by the lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong calls earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively modest ratio of for the sp but run the numbers using earnings and suddenly the market has a far steeper pe of did we get into this mess investors and analysts have been earnings for years and for years reasonable people could more or less agree on how to do it then came the bubble along with increased pressure from wall street for companies to meet their quarterly earnings forecasts suddenly companies that hadnt turned a profit by any conventional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants these customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and allowed upstart companies to show a profit tower of babel pro forma formulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to the same company casting doubt on their validity and these days the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever so forma but they arent followed widely enough to be a standard investors are facing a tower of babel says robert k elliott former chief of the american institute of certified public accountants and a partner its not standardized and the numbers are not makes it tough to evaluate a performance in the quarter ended on sept networks corp offered shareholders at least three earnings numbers to choose from by conservative accounting the telecommunications giant lost a share the company also provided two some acquisition costs and restructuring charges and a still better cents loss that further excluded billion of incremental charges such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivables wall street chose the rosiest you bet companies defend their pro forma calculations by that gives them better insight into their future the goal is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for those operations there are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operating earnings says it is an effort to provide some continuity and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company besides as companies like to point out they still have to report earnings are free to ignore everything no starker lesson in the shortcomings of than the billion asset by uniphase corp the biggest charge of the year near the height of the bull market in july the san jose calif maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor inc for billion in stock when the deal closed in february its assets ballooned from billion to billion but by then shares of and other makers were collapsing to bring its acquisitions into line with their new value the company took charges of billion despite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions and involved no cash paid required that the charges be taken out of so according to lost billion in the fiscal year ending in staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years added up to only and the company argue that besides not involving cash the was all about the past a of values that had gotten out to analyze the prospects they excluded the billion charge the accounting is not designed to make things look better but to describe what happened says uniphase chief financial officer anthony r muller and well live with the consequences whatever they are analysts make a similar defense my goal is to figure out what the business is going to produce so that we can value the company says glacial pace are pro forma numbers to judge and thats the kind of ambiguity sp and others would like to eliminate in november sp circulated a memo on how to standardize operating earnings under the proposal operating earnings would include the purchases research and development restructuring costs including severance from ongoing operations and the cost to the company of stock options it would exclude expenses impairment of goodwill litigation settlements and the gain or loss on the sale sp applied roughly that formula to uniphase it split the difference between wall street and because of differences in what each in their earnings calculations the results were chaotic using the company lost a share sp figures it lost while the company put the loss at cents meanwhile wall street says it made accounting standards board the group in charge of chairman edmund l says will be addressing the problems still investors shouldnt expect any improvement soon the pace of change at tends to be glacial it typically takes four years to complete a new standard for example the board realized that standards on restructuring charges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda in june the board finally issued a draft of a new standard asked for comments and held a public hearing in october the board said it still wasnt ready to put a fix in place now the recession has set off another wave of restructuring charges and the still doesnt have new slow pace means the sometimes fail to react to sudden changes in the market the most recent failure followed the terrorist attacks on september an task force unable to come up with a set of rules for separating september costs from general expenses instead told companies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a general performance many companies have nevertheless broken those costs out in their unaudited press more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter indeed is shaping up to be one for the record books a poor economy and the devastating aftereffects of september have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that are unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen but theres a growing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to of the past within that vast category of supposedly onetime charges the temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now while investors are braced for bad news not only can managers sweep away yesterdays errors but tomorrows earnings will look even basic question comes down to what constitutes a special charge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to distort the truth about a performance usually big charges fall into a few categories including charges for laying off workers and restructuring a company charges for assets that have lost value since they were purchased charges for investments that have lost value and charges for inventory that has become obsolete in a recent study harvard business school professor mark t bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling these charges unusual that gives them a rationale for excluding them from their pro forma of critics disagree saying such charges are often an inevitable part of the business cycle and should be reflected in a earnings history they certainly should not be ignored by investors charges are real shareholder wealth thats been lost argues david w tice manager of the prudent bear fund a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent thats up so far this year its money they spent on something no longer worth what it was a correction of past earnings or a reserve for costs moving forward whatever the reason its a real cost to the company and that hurts shareholders without standards excessive writeoffs from operating earnings can obscure actual performance without any rules companies calculate operating earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best possible light dell computer corp is a good example of this heads i win tails you lose school of accounting for years dell benefited from its investments and was happy to include those gains reported earnings where they appeared as a separate line on the income statement but this year when those gains turned to losses the issued pro forma numbers that excluded that million drag dell spokesman michael says the press releases and sec filings break out investment income and give numbers as well as pro forma view the numbers are reported clearly says its all out there for the consuming public past puffery many experts believe are a sign that past performance was exaggerated what should investors make of a company such as gateway inc two restructuring charges in the first and third quarters minus a small extraordinary gain totaled billion or about million more than the company made in combined which is the truer picture of its performance and potential the writeoffs or the earnings writeoffs for customer financing example when increased its reserves for credit extended by million in september it effectively admitted it had booked sales in the past to companies that couldnt effect performance in those earlier periods in addition says and accounting for credit are unrelated issues tech companies sharp downturn in their industry for the big writeoffs and these arent isolated examples peter l publisher of newsletter economics portfolio strategy found that from to of earnings vanished into can also distort future performance critics contend that excess reserves are often used as a sort of cookie jar from which earnings can be taken in future quarters to meet wall streets expectations or charges taken this year for example which is apt to be a lousy one for most companies anyway might include costs that would otherwise have been taken in future periods prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earnings rules for figuring operating earnings would help but this is an area that will always involve a certain amount of therefore certain amount of abuse people are going to write off everything in the next two quarters because theyre having a bad year anyway says robert g a mercer management of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug them off believing that with the bad news out in the open the company is poised for a brighter future since gateway detailed its charge of million on oct wall street has bid the stock up compared with a for the sp though investors should take exactly the opposite message if for example part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training spending or research and development the cuts could depress future performance says baruch lev a professor of accounting at the stern school of business at new york university are these really onetime events he asks or is this the beginning of an avalanche indeed morgan stanley dean witter co strategist steve has found that in the year following a big to earnings companies have the stock market by percentage points la la land investors are apt to be faced with more huge writeoffs next year even if the continue to worsen why the transition to a new rule that changes the way companies account for asset that reflects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangible assets under the new rule companies will have to assess their properties periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their an informal survey by financial executives international of its member controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect to take more figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task unless there is a comparable company or factory with an established market price valuing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules what this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors coming up with their own tests for impairment says the stern schools professor paul r brown its la la the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings games it could also be an impetus for in the wake of the fiasco indeed there are some signs of a backlash the real estate investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings with its funds from operations or but now some have begun to revert old earnings r of san corp shifted back to in the reason i dont like is very simple says one numbers look better ones even if they had identical fundamental are other steps could take to improve financial reporting and restore status trevor s harris an accounting expert at morgan stanley says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between operations and income from financial transactions says companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how on earnings an easy step would be to require companies to file releases with the the least says lev companies must clearly explain how their pro forma numbers relate to the numbers otherwise he says investors see numbers floating there and where did they come from in todays unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize writeoffs no question is more important to are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin bottom line according to generally accepted accounting principles called reported earnings these are the numbers the securities exchange commission accepts in its adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be the ongoing business although it sounds deceptively like a operating income revenue minus the costs of doing business an audited term for operating earnings neither core nor operating earnings according to set rules they can include or exclude anything forma term for operating earnings popularized by it such basic costs as marketing and before interest taxes depreciation and amortization of pro forma it was initially highlighted by industries high debt loads such as cable tv but has since come to be new term for pro general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual to be excluded from future earnings taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to market value many companies are now taking these charges on funds that bought internet and other stocks same idea as asset impairments except theyre used to write down a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible these charges will explode in the first quarter of because of in accounting that eliminates and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair accrued expense not usually cash to cover future costs of closing of a business a plant or of firings these are projected costs overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are the value of an asset such as a plant or stock investment it excused as a bookkeeping exercise but there may have been a real ago that now proves ill spent or there may have been associated such as dow jones company inc all rights reserved the numbers did the company earn thats the most basic question an investor can ever ask the equity culture that has generated so much growth over the years depends on a clear answer but getting one has become impossible corp just announced that its earnings for the past three years were overstated by half a billion dollars how did one of the biggest companies on the new york stock exchange manage to inflate its earnings by without auditors analysts ratings agencies and the business press included discovering it in part blame the breakdown of standardized accounting rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of corporate america the us needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a clear picture of financial performance without integrity in financial reporting the us cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in marketplace page bubble was the first indication that there was something seriously wrong with accounting standards companies without much of a business model customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expenses in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations wall street conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in soon the method of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within a company it is now stricter adherence to accounting rules wont solve the entire problem the generally accepted accounting principles allow all kinds of onetime expenses and noncash charges this obscures the performance of ongoing operations no one can fathom what are true operating earnings because no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense the result is total confusion take earnings per share for the standard index for the second quarter under call standards it is but its according to sp and under how can investors make intelligent financial accounting standards board clearly is failing to do its job it has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings and relates them to net earnings but it hasnt delivered the rating agency standard owned by the companies as is is doing a better job it recently drew

accounting firms the sec created in could not stop a company from issuing stock but it could make it disclose all relevant facts about risks in its laws were written in the midst of the great depression which followed the stock market crash they were designed to remedy abuses such as the case of charles mitchell head of city national bank a predecessor firm of todays who sold his own shares is he bet on their price before the crash without informing other shareholders before securities laws mitchell had no legal requirement to disclose his activities once the laws were passed all

most people an mind that the economy is contracting or that prices are falling and profit margins are getting squeezed or that most industries are unlikely to grow more than percent a year even after the recovery is here the the game these days is boosting the stock price and the surest way to do that is to promise and deliver profit growth to wall streets cadre of analysts and money not just in

conclusion that that was the norm said michael a professor at the harvard business school management came to believe they could get a big company to grow percent year after year it was insanity and in

masons value trust a billion mutual chairman of mercer delta consulting says this tyranny of growth continues to lead too many companies to expand too quickly make acquisitions or diversify out of their areas of expertise the experience on that is that their shareholders wind up paying dearly for those mistakes he many of the celebrated corporate crackups of the past year costly foray into financing corps debacle with credit card lending truck glut and the record billion writeoff of acquisition uniphase corp came about as a result of companies trying to push earnings growth to the executives certainly have plenty of incentive to play the growth game whether consciously or unconsciously most have compensation packages that include bonuses stock and stock options all tied directly to growth in earnings and share price and a rising stock price gives them a valuable new currency currency that can be used to buy earnings growth through mergers and acquisitions and to offer valuable stock options when recruiting top management and technical stock option has a particularly pernicious impact according to david vice chairman of mercer management consulting inc and coauthor of the profit zone options become more valuable as the price of the company stock rises above the point at which the options are issued on the other hand if things go bad it doesnt matter how much the price of the below the strike price the value remains zero as a result of this asymmetry between upside potential and downside risk says it is common for executives to take bigger risks with their companies than they otherwise would also plays a role chief executives who deliver year after year of earnings growth wind up being lionized in business books on magazine covers and on news

growth story to tell or cant deliver on it risk finding themselves in early garten dean of the yale school of management recently interviewed the leading corporate chief executives for a new book the mind of and more often than not garten said the executives told him off the record that while they knew the expectations about earnings growth are often unreasonable and unsustainable they had no choice but to participate or risk being dismissed as someone who simply doesnt get system penalized anyone who didnt play the game garten said as a result executives find themselves on a treadmill always in a desperate search for ways to deliver the next increment of growth that will justify the unrealistic earnings expectations in which they themselves were william steele said he has seen it time and again in the consumer products sector that he follows for bank of america securities inc as companies that had always been solid singles hitters suddenly started swinging for the youve seen is companies making acquisitions abusing their balance sheets by taking on too much debt or issuing too much stock and in their brands said the case of freeport co which for more than years had enjoyed steady earnings growth by buying up housewares companies and them bringing in new management scrapping unprofitable products consolidating distribution and winning more space on retail shelves but by the late after acquisitions that included cookware window blinds and card files the number of good turnaround prospects had dwindled and with growth in sales of consumer products slowing to single digits executives needed something that would keep them in something they thought was for years one of the most respected companies among executives and investors but one that had stumbled badly beginning in it was far and away biggest acquisition bought with newly issued stock valued at billion a percent premium over market price at the deal closed in the spring of and financial performance has declined ever since a reflection not only of the slowing economy but of problems within the company itself total profits for the combined firm are barely higher than they were before the acquisition and because of the debt taken on and new shares issued to finance the purchase the best measures of financial performance earnings per share on assets have both declined after the company repeatedly failed to meet the quarterly sales and growth target it had promised wall street chief executive john j was fired in october of last that history the current economic uncertainty and continued quarterly earnings one might think that new executive team would steer clear of making grand promises to wall street but in june six months on the job the new chief executive joseph galli jr told wall street analysts that a restructuring program he had instituted would allow the company to post a percent earnings increase in at analysts say the stock price now reflects an expectation that will meet this growth an interview last week william t chief financial officer explained that the percent growth target for next year was reasonable because the profits this year against which next years will be compared are so depressed going forward however he acknowledged that growth rates would be closer to percent than percent and they would come from squeezing more profit out of existing brands rather than through not sure we see the enormous upside potential that we once did said who insisted nonetheless that wall street should continue to value as a growth this day chief executives such as warren as to why executives still cant resist the urge to promise investors any particular level of earnings growth given all the uncertainties a business in the annual report to shareholders of his berkshire inc in february he noted that only a handful of companies have ever been able to sustain percent earnings growth for more than a promises he said not

chief executives of sunbeam xerox waste management and lost their jobs in recent years after earnings overstatements were uncovered during their berkshire is a significant investor in the washington post co which like berkshire provides no earnings guidance to wall street johnson the former chairman of mae has heard all these criticisms and can even add a few of his own but he said that for every company that overpromised and overreached there were others where the focus on earnings growth has led to breakthrough innovations successful new corporate strategies and big gains in what makes american capitalism so unique and so successful said johnson whose ability to deliver on a promise of earnings growth in every year but one led to a dramatic increase in maes stock price during his tenure it also made johnson a very rich a tricky balance said david winters president and chief of mutual series fund inc a new mutual fund you dont want companies to be sleepy or set the bar so low that they can easily step over it but you dont want companies that overpromise and no chief executive took the goal of posting each year more seriously than john f welch jr who recently retired as chairman of general electric co on jack watch division managers who failed to contribute to the corporate goal were routinely fired their divisions sold off and critics have charged that the unrelenting pressure led on occasion to accounting gimmicks and questionable business practices a charge welch repeatedly according to noel a professor at the university of michigan business school it was the demand for earnings growth year after year that forced managers of ges manufacturing divisions to get into the growing and profitable business of servicing and financing the turbines and medical equipment they dont know when it would ever be the right decision not to try to grow fast said coauthor of a book titled every business is a growth business and even while acknowledging that companies have been known to do dumb things in the pursuit of earnings growth the good ones you dont have goals that force executives to stretch themselves and their organization you dont optimize performance guru james collins disagrees in a new book good to great collins argues that the companies that sustain really high growth rates over long periods of time are those that dont set growth as an explicit goal rather collins says the best companies operate less out of some corporate bravado than a determination to understand their business and their success and to capitalize on that companies dont come about because the wants to be a celebrity or please the and certainly not because he or she wants to hit the top targets on the compensation plan collins said last week the common thread among the of the truly great companies is that their ambition is to build something that can outlast themselves the growth comes as a byproduct of said that the only way to lick corporate americas growth addiction is for more executives to muster the courage to stand up to wall street and begin setting realistic expectations for their companies such might occasionally require a to tell investors that his stock is overvalued a truly novel idea in todays environment where executives almost reflexively complain that their share price is too it might require executives at some companies to make clear that may be inappropriate for growth funds and generally get the shareholders they deserve said miller masons money norman augustine the retired chairman of martin corp warns that standing up to wall street may not be as easy as it all sit around complaining about the mentality on wall street and the fund managers who say theyll dump our stocks if we dont show earnings growth

in question are yet to come out but what has come out is bad this apart a billion dollar hit for a company of the size billion or cash flow billion of is by itself hardly a death warrant but it turned out to be just that for because it was too arrogant perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors confidence somewhat and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between trading and producing as for the first the professional analysts were surely aware of the opaqueness of the few questioned the management aggressively on the subject

analysts there was also safety in numbers skilling claimed that operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies bringing derivatives theory to trading in power and gas obviously the fate of long term capital management led to more sober management of trading the role of markets should be to reduce the distance and cost between producer and consumer one does feel that there is something a society that values in terms of compensation the trader dont forget this is just a euphemism for the speculator over the producer whether in the bond
