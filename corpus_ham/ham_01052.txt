and i checked we only see the two trades numbers you reference none other it is our opinion that these trades represent all of the financial gas positions note that these two trades ended w the settlement cannot speak to power or any other commodity however i can provide that credit didnt show any position exposure for tri state which we think is consistent considering there is no existing forward gas market price exposure to tri summary my opinion is that there are no other positions however only beth apollos group can provide a conclusive answer hope this a reminder that received a letter from tristate last month and you are going to verify that deal nos and are the only active financial deals with if you can confirm then we can indicate on the master log that tristate has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of wholesale smith street tx
