allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs tennessee couch threw for yards and a td last week against green bay which best day among last week ahead of guys like manning clearly the

yards allowed over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to people have a hard time understanding what these provide saying couch will have a great game check the rankings we have him what im saying is that he has a great hereagainst the titans struggled against the pass all passing game vs atlanta exploded for yards and a td last week favorite

interceptions against indy sunday wayne was the with coles seeing less action te anthony td the bills rank in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed and in fantasy points allowed to louis passing game vs indianapolis warner had an off day for him with just yards and hes a must start every week the trouble with him is he ball around so well its tough to predict which wr will see action have a very hard time benching guys like holt bruce or even an eye on the thumb he tweaked but hes saying hes ok the in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and points allowed to passing game vs detroit booker catching yards worth of passes isnt as remarkable until jim miller only threw for yards i guess that makes wr hes clearly the favored option this team is all thomas and their defense though so im not too excited about any guys outside of booker even with the the lions rank yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy to bay passing game vs minnesota made the most out of yards throwing for last too good to sit against anyone antonio freeman and billy solid options and bubba franks seems to have picked up where he this year the vikings rank in passing yards allowed per the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs st louis was back on track again with yards td and week the interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is one of the leagues best marvin harrison was incredible everything in his sight the rams rank in passing per game over the last four weeks remember chris them last week for the year they rank in fantasy to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs denver passing funny when people get excited about throwing just yards whats happening hes spoiled us im not worried about him with jerry rice and tim brown theyre still one of the better in the game charlie garner is a nice target too this face a suddenly vulnerable denver team that ranks in allowed per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed bay passing game vs baltimore johnson put together a great game with and interceptions on johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside i dont see many other viable ff options johnson to johnson is of this passing game baltimore ranks in passing yards game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs arizona yard day last week against the rams was surprising as the ranked as the passing defense over the last weeks going into donald hayes was ultra active

and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs oakland should be back and ready to go gus is out for so jackson will be the guy rod smith is the only note and hes a guy you can never count out the

points allowed to passing game vs kansas city had a day last week with yards and a td is a must start and deserves a hard look in any league the chiefs rank in passing yards allowed per the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy to and in fantasy points allowed to city passing game vs jacksonville green put together a decent day with yards td and snoop was the preferred wr while derrick very little tony was fairly involved although not as much owners would like to see hes still a must start for te jaguars rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs green bay tuned this week for whether todd or wynn gets the vikings have imploded if starts its much better news if wynn starts cris carter seemed to be the favored it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to it been his last game in minnesota honestly its sit cris carter or randy moss regardless of who is at a sure thing the packers rank in passing yards allowed over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs new york giants eagle passing game is all about to duce now good owners but not the ideal situation for james thrash mitchell saw most of the action at wr but they werent todd is in the mix which makes it even tougher to wr the giants may be without jason this week which would be rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and points allowed to passing game vs cincinnati stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up week and yards theres serious talk about him and ward and both deserve a look for most in particular is coming on lately the bengals than many realize against the pass lately they rank yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy to diego passing game vs seattle was awful early but made a great recovery to finish with and with no interceptions theres a lot of talk about brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think seen him last week if that was the case either way not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues of the was clearly the go to guy with te freddie jones seeing well the rank in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs san diego hasnt carried many ff teams this season and i doubt now hes still a below average player robinson jackson are the primary guys while alexander will be the passing game as well the chargers rank in passing per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs new orleans banks threw for yards last week in a tough game with and rod both saw roughly equal numbers of their way he only caught a couple but te saw thrown his way you could do a lot worse for a te plus hes cool name the saints rank in passing yards allowed per game last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs new york jets pelt put together a yard td passing game last week as moulds and peerless price were featured fairly evenly this week face a pretty tough jets team that ranks in passing yards game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs san francisco cant imagine youre in contention in week with many of these guys roster quincy carters given me very little to make me think hell of anything of course for the gamblers rocket or can make something happen with just one throw but theyre san francisco is ranked in passing yards allowed per game last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs chicago mike gave a valiant effort but its still very clear hes granted hes got talent and potential but hes still johnnie morton is the wr of choice but te david sloan actually balls thrown his way last week than any other lion receiver unusual for a new to focus on the shorter routes of a te and it the bears rank in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed and in fantasy points allowed to orleans passing game vs washington people expected tampa bay to start a track meet with new orleans but thats what happened aaron brooks had late as the to rally from a big deficit stats are stats though and will take them any way they can get them joe horn and saw tons of action with cam shockingly injured williams is back as the te so thats good news the redskins rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in allowed to york giants passing game vs philadelphia collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week he threw yards and td amani and ike saw lots of action seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too the eagles lately where they rank in passing yards allowed per game last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points and in fantasy points allowed to their blitzing style young plenty of trouble but collins experience should help passing game vs cleveland played a gutsy game last week at well less than yards td and interceptions derrick mason is still guy and saw more looks than te frank which is this week theyll face a surprising brown defense that ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in allowed to passing game vs miami chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game throwing for yards and against buffalo martin and favorite brian all had great you know though these guys are very inconsistent this week a miami defense that ranks in passing yards allowed per game last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs tampa bay continues to at least not hurt the offense he threw for last week with no or interceptions is target at wr with shannon always threatening to make the ravens face the who are hot right now ranking yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy to passing game vs pretty much have to avoid all these guys jon threw for and interceptions his most newsworthy accomplishment was shouting match with wr chad johnson peter was fielding a punt on his own yard line should start they teased us early but these are clearly still the ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to francisco passing game vs dallas only had yards and td although he was very close on hes still a must start in my book hes too good and has too is of course a starter but stokes or could be worth a look te eric johnson is still very involved passing game dallas ranks in passing yards allowed per game last four weeks so theyve been tough for the year they rank points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to but i dont see how you can sit and just loaded see our rankings for exactly where we guys analytics inc all rights reserved
