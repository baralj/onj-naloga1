december game against the lions right now he is having off on his knee stay away from bradford in your fantasy next kc eric bass updated returned to practice on wednesday and will likely return for game against new england although he is still listed on the injury report head coach gunther right now id say hell play said but well today brings since isnt a definite starter this week be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it especially with the fantasy playoffs smith mia fear updated injured right hamstring has made significant progress since last weeks game against the colts and the dolphins are that he could return for this weeks game against experiencing a slight tweak in the hamstring after smith still believes he will be ready to go i feel fine i have no pain in my leg im running and cutting without any fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation however would to steer clear of smith this week playing in the cold at buffalo smiths performance which is a chance you wont want to take at of the mia mckay neal updated to earlier reports the dolphins are now optimistic that be their starting quarterback for this weeks game against buffalo percent of the snaps with the first team during wednesdays reported that he felt fine it would be a remarkable recovery who couldnt even raise his right arm on sunday if hes hes starting said head coach dave even if he fielder isnt a very strong option for fantasy owners who to their leagues chi updated has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season where have we before during the bulked up to pounds and run over the opposition he looked slow carrying the ball this season replaced at hb by james allen with hb and allen in may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere he is down to already and would like to reach even if he does reach this count on him being too productive wait and see if he reemerges as before you gamble and put him on your fantasy team next chi top dogs updated is listed as questionable but will be the emergency for against the bears behind shane and backup mark that is done for the fantasy season his him helpless for the latter part of but even when he he didnt produce too king tb tori updated practiced wednesday and will start sunday against dallas he sat out monday because of a lower back strain but said he felt fine most of the snaps as the began preparations for the hasnt been too productive in recent weeks and dont expect that against dallas this week the cowboys have only allowed yards per game this season but king is still one of the better the league he may not have a stellar game this sunday but will be to help your fantasy team in the wr dal free agent updated injured his left ankle in practice on wednesday leaving for sundays game at tampa bay the cowboys who have by injuries all season long can to lose become one of their more consistent receivers in recent weeks should avoid starting any of dallas receivers other than for the duration of the greisen free agent updated the shoulder injury to backup dave brown greisen will likely number two quarterback this week against the bengals he has nine passes in three career appearances but could see some this week if starter jake plummer the rib injury that out of last weeks game against the giants fantasy owners should quarterbacks this week at all costs especially with the for most williams no free agent updated could be back in time for the final regular season game on theres a chance he can come back coach jim said were shooting for the last game but hopefully the playoffs most will be over by week but if your team is still playing will definitely wr sf martin updated will play this week against the chargers but at this point he is enough to take a gamble on ill definitely play this week its all a matter of how much pain i can tolerate toe and swollen and he cant run at top speed dont expect him to good numbers this week use another receiver instead of wr free agent updated did a good job replacing ike last week catching for yards in new win he will start in place of teammate once again but dont expect the same type of the redskins it would be wise to use other receivers on your week if possible especially considering that will himself lined up across from sanders for most of the wr mckay neal updated accounted for yards of total offense and a touchdown in nights win over arizona he will face off against a secondary this week that held him to only three catches and in the teams first meeting if your other have more this week it might be wise to bench wr tori updated will miss his second straight game this week against is still suffering from a punishing hit from lions safety kurt ago that resulted in a bruised sternum joe will once barber the updated is having a surprisingly solid fantasy season he accounted for from scrimmage and a touchdown in last weeks win over the giants will no doubt continue to use barber as one of their threats so he will always have a chance at being you have a stacked backfield you could do a lot worse than in your starting martin updated ran the ball times for yards and a touchdown in last over arizona dont expect those types of numbers this week however face off against a washington squad that will be hungry for a week four the skins held to only yards rushing and this be much different keep on your bench if your roster collins matt updated completed passes for yards and one touchdown in win over arizona he has been playing well in recent weeks touchdown passes in his last five games he will face off against opponent this week namely the washington redskins and their pass defense collins was unimpressive in the teams first meeting may want to consider benching him this week if your roster allows k ind top dogs updated missed his only field goal attempt against the dolphins at the end of regulation that would have sent the game the miss was his first since week two against oakland one of best kickers so continue to start him as you leagues harrison wr ind eric bass updated only caught four passes last week against miami lucky for that two of them were for touchdowns he will go up against a this week that held him to only four catches and yards in its now time for the playoffs however so harrison should be in every week until your season ends one way or james ind martin updated edge just keeps on producing rushing for yards and catching for yards in last weeks loss to miami he faces the jets a team he lit up for yards rushing and a touchdown in week needs this game to stay in the playoff hunt and james will be the colts main man on manning ind tori updated completed passes for yards and two touchdowns in loss to miami he will face the jets this week in new york not be a good sign for fantasy owners the colts havent faired well cold this season losing on the road to both chicago and green bay this week as always and hope that he can break away from his weather chandler hunter updated will be replaced at by rookie doug johnson for the final the team stated that this move is aimed at allowing chris time to heal his wounds it will also give them a chance to considering passing performances it would be wise picking up johnson especially as your team enters the an eye on him though if he plays well he may be worth drafting wr ten the updated tested his hamstring before sundays game against jacksonville team decided not to let him play just before he is close ready for a return but likely needs to get more involved in carl practiced last week but we felt and he felt if he had gone pushed it a little bit he had that risk factor of reinjuring it jeff fisher i would assume hed be close to play sunday dont expect solid fantasy numbers out of him however as had a reception since october edwards wr pit updated impressed coach bill with a reception last sunday but he hasnt yet put himself back in the picture as long as ward continues to play well at expect anything from edwards over the seasons final weeks check him next johnson free agent updated will start the teams final three games of the season in place battered chris chandler dont expect johnson to do too much better have a good game against the this week but overall receivers dont get open pit fear updated steelers have listed as questionable with a calf injury on report for sundays game against oakland he has routinely been probable for games this season yet has played every game more that has performed well in recent weeks despite the absence dawson dawson has missed three games with a and is listed as questionable this week but dont allow his affect your decision on whether to start hawkins wr pit free agent updated will be listed as questionable on the steelers injury report game against oakland he is expected to play though as he was as questionable last sunday but made the start anyway if he cant the man hawkins replaced in the lineup would the pit free agent updated will miss his sixth straight game on sunday against a broken foot he is expected to run this week for the first time suffered the injury so he should be able to return by the following expect anything out of over the final weeks jerome has a firm grip on the starting tb free agent updated is still recovering from a bruised knee and is not expected to the cowboys sunday he rarely fields kicks anymore and is as a blocker on the return hakim wr updated injured his wrist in last sundays game against the saints and for this weeks against the panthers if he is play look for ricky to receive extended action as the given performance last week in which he caught a td be worth picking up to replace hakim if you play in a fantasy allows more than two bass player active dt updated lions defense will have to pick their poison thursday when they face will they randy moss or cris carter or both what do about and robert smith it may not matter if they moss he has been known to make catches in but carter is a different story they focused their energies carter in the first game and held him to three catches for moss had receiving yards and three thursdays game could be along one for the lions defense if you have them hope that they can find away to contain minnesota and score some points for your fantasy active updated returned to practice on wednesday and will likely return for game against new england although he is still listed as the injury report head coach gunther is optimistic id say hell play said but well see what since isnt a definite starter this week it would be wise touse another quarterback if your roster allows it especially with playoffs davis reserve updated performed on davis leg tuesday showed a stress reaction on leg which is a precursor of a stress fracture he will have placed in a boot for about three weeks to prevent a stress he will essentially miss the remainder of the regular season if davis on your fantasy team and youre not in a keeper league its holding onto him at this anders reserve updated kansas city star says the chiefs intend to stick with veterans down that means anders will continue to start at halfback over frank however might see at fullback in place of and warren moon will continue to be the no over todd smith active updated carried times for yards and a touchdown in thursdays the cowboys with marshall recovering from injury and struggling smith is without a doubt the best fantasy right for him to have another solid outing against the shaky lions this harrison active wr updated only caught four passes last week against miami lucky for that two of them were for touchdowns he will go up against a this week that held him to only four catches and yards in its now time for the playoffs however so harrison should be in every week until your season ends one way or hayes active wr updated was deactivated for mondays game against green bay with a isaac his replacement had no catches in the game as long remains out muhammad should be expected to be the focus of passing game much like he was monday reserve updated was against washington accounting for yards of and two touchdowns in the eagles win at field he offensive unit on his shoulders and singlehandedly kept philadelphia place in the east up next will face a tough who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the jaguars dont numbers from this week but do expect him to be the focal offense once active k updated has made field goals this season but told the that he will play elsewhere next season rather than try to incumbent kicker john next year will be an agent in march and has been filling in for who tore the in leg during the preseason its not that im not enjoying my said its a great scenario to be doing this well but i in as replacement and when that person gets be the horn active wr updated was productive once again sunday catching seven passes for yards still the primary receiver but his numbers could suffer in upcoming starter aaron brooks spreads the ball around and scrambles more than robinson reserve wr updated having cade throw to him has really hurt playing with in his first six games this season robinson had for yards average and four touchdowns in his last robinson has just catches for yards yards with except for one quarter against the eagles jim miller and were the quarterbacks in those ballgames is still or so away from playing so look for robinson to continue to allen active updated his three fumbles on sunday allen remains in the bears plans and why wouldnt he he is the bears starting halfback and gaining yards this season allen will be a restricted free this season but personnel vp mark has stated that he would bring him back next season if allen remains confident he will be a backup next season look for him to have a big game this week packers defense that allowed carolina rookie brad hoover to run all morris reserve wr updated is starting to fade after some heroics he has been and dont be hesitant to bench him at this important point reserve dt updated cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive sunday first team to achieve the feat this season the ravens defense another dominating performance foiled in its quest to post fifth shutout of the season baltimore held the browns to points and a staggering net yards the ravens also had six interception and two fumble recoveries in the game its probably safe that owners of this defense are already although its bye week next fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this their playoff run as the team faces weaker offenses san diego coming off the inc and
