hi to avoid and game heres how i see the this week exactly where i rank to determine who to start just may be more favorable than another that doesnt id start the player with the best the info is be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by info passing game vs bronco defense if seen one trend defenses to start your wr against the broncos and your tough on the running game but easy against i get into whether a or the situation bottom line is go with your passing guys against denver they rank passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks jon another start and while i have a hard time putting too much faith been ok derrick sean see lots and rookie darrell working his way back into the mix been sitting on alexander coach mike did say to see more of alexander in passing downs but still not about him passing game vs bengal defense once again keep an eye on this week early but already being game time decision as he tries to recover from knee and ankle your fingers crossed as a tasty vs the weak bengal they rank in passing yards allowed per game over the and are just playing out the season cornerback rodney heath is the year with a bad shoulder and that should make things even the clear cut wr with chris sanders the on the team or at least most utilized is te frank to get back to his normal high level of player vs seattle just do it the are anemic did start to throw some but still at least a couple weeks more gus another start and if looking for regain that yard form he showed early on this is his best chance it rod ed the usual must starts at wr excellent plays at te start and feel pretty good about it especially passing game vs charger defense san diego made a run back at on defense but thinking fallen back down to well average over the last four weeks they rank in passing per game for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed opposing the ravens come back after a bye week off and should to roll trent playing exceptionally well and patrick do well the most enticing be shannon san diego ranks just in fantasy to the opposing te for the louis passing game vs viking defense i think you keep kurt for long sure he had an awful game last week but some of be blamed on the who i bet you see drop half of what this time the vikings still give up lots of passing yards in passing yards allowed per game over the last month for the rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing isaac the best wr while been surprisingly disappointing still worth a start though has a chance vikings just have the secondary to keep up with these passing game vs colt defense i probably get more mail from my rob johnson than i do for any other player i make no apologies just like the guy he simply has major troubles finishing although he draws a great this week against indy one of the defenses in the league safety chad has a concussion and so they might be even less effective on the other hand definitely seem to up the intensity at home as you can see from not thinking too much of johnson again this week but he a good eric moulds is the primary wr as always with and jeremy mcdonald picking up the scraps te jay is target and gets plenty of passing game vs giants defense the stewart getting awfully crowded lately but for good reason playing football more importantly he cleared a huge hurdle sunday leadership and toughness coming back in the game after injuring the giants defense is very beatable but do understand coach media games where he says more than joe in are apparently working as his playoff guarantee seems to the team the pass defense still ranks in passing per game over the last month though for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to the opposing ward is the wr on this team and feel fine starting him not even the true guy but you could do worse then taking a reach on bobby shaw for i like him over starter courtney hawkins even te mark is choice as done more in the last two weeks than done in city passing game vs panthers defense dreading the firing as he may make dick look like iron mike a here could help him keep his job which may have chief fans pulling from a ff perspective i like elvis here he night he was clearly back from the finger troubles as usual game is a mess but good news for elvis owners as go with been working for them throwing the ball te is having the incredible season we all predicted for him and the best receiver on the team derrick alexander is a sure too sylvester morris continues to regress which is ranks just in passing yards allowed per game over the games although for the year fared better ranking points allowed to the opposing part of that is they seem up a lot of yards without yielding the td so be leery in td passing game vs chief defense if been fence sitting with this may be a week to take a close look at him the in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks may be missing cb james hasty questionable with a knee muhammad is playing like a man possessed lately and a donald hayes got through last game without reinjuring and a solid option as well te kris is no wesley a pretty good player the chiefs do get back home where but i like this francisco passing game vs saints defense the pass defense than people think and the saints defense is worse than many the last four games new orleans ranks in passing yards game the rank in reality both defenses are and both teams feature who will be winging the ball picked up right where he left off last week against a tough san it was great news for fans as he looks on his in the meantime jerry rice showed he still has a few tricks in i be surprised to see tai streets and stokes time at expense though as many feel the hall of the plans for charlie garner is always a threat ball te greg clark is suddenly a producer so worth a shot could be a passing game vs cardinal defense two teams heading for in the post season but about all they have in just ran out of time as playing well now downhill from an already low position arizona ranks over four weeks in passing yards allowed per game mark had to his non throwing shoulder but appears to be fine he could be play along with jimmy smith and arizona williams is a player but he do it all the biggest the jaguar passing game is talking coach tom into calling besides a fred taylor run which will likely result in a each passing game vs ram defense you need any analysis from know better start cris carter and randy rams are much improved on pass defense where over the last four rank in passing yards allowed per game still though counting robert smith are no orleans passing game vs defense aaron brooks continues to of the better stories of this season facing a time full of youngsters although playing better of late ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks but before losing safety lance to a torn last week have joe horn catching the ball and horn should continue to jackson is a solid wr and te andrew glover has come alive passing game vs packer defense of course all this hinges on of one charlie batch if he go all bets are off in if he can go you should hedge your bets a bit as already good shot to the chest can mean taking a seat for batch not though against a green bay defense ranked in allowed per game johnnie morton is likely the top choice at wr moore in the mix too germane may be able to make this week as been practicing this week i keep an eye out as might pay dividends for astute owners who scoop i can see plenty of james stewart in this one though as the be really nasty for this passing game vs patriot defense this full of story lines as healthy cade remains on the bench this week in favor of shane the juicy rumor here is that according to a story in the would receive a million escalator clause if he plays of the offensive snaps this year and next currently at aside will be without wr robinson the year with a bulging disk in his back new england ranks last four weeks in passing yards allowed per game but the turmoil toll on the bears the bears will also be without offensive gary who took the job some think that will be i honestly have a hard time getting too excited about and marty passing game vs redskin defense really interested to see team responds to new coach terry be surprised if kick things up several notches although i do find it odd that in charge of the worst performing part of the team passing game is they decided to elevate to head coach who knows troy try to get through another game without being maimed have and wayne to throw to but neither guy looks too a pretty tough defense dallas showed last week the complete faith they have in when they kept feeding smith the ball trailed tampa by a mile david and jackie harris both along with passing game vs brown defense two teams used to bringing rear lately meet with one soaring and the other limping finds himself in a strange spot here the browns are so the rush that most teams choose to rush the ball on them at of throwing it but with the best rusher decide which way going to beat the browns charles johnson small much te chad lewis is the best receiver and he some noise im interested to see how quickly they work in chris passing game vs buccaneer defense another good case miami is better throwing the ball than people give for and the as dominant stopping the pass like over the last four weeks tampa ranks in passing yards game very solid for sure but not dominating jay astound his critics as he threw for sunday i think the same production here but still a decent play leslie been my favorite wr here but with his surgery it looks like tony finally get a start continues to make sick passing game vs eagle defense this is where doug gets the start this week because rookie wynn go due wr kevin johnson is running the scout team in practice tough eagles secondary he likely will have trouble no matter where up i look for much here from any of these passing game vs titan defense the bengals just die corey keeps running the ball like a mad bull and intent on proving to folks he really can play at this may be able to but he draws a tough sunday in a titan team they rank over the last four week in passing yards allowed although they may catch break as cb is nursing a and will likely have to play with a brace wr peter have his contact lenses thursday and that could make often worth a roll of the dice for the start as he has play york giant passing game vs steeler defense the steelers seemed the spoiler role last week against oakland and they get another week against the giants playing tough pass they rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last kerry steady but not exciting be throwing to amani joe it looks like ike may fully ready yet this week keep an eye on that one though te pete been nearly the factor thought passing game vs jets defense the raiders look to bounce back and you can bet they do a better job keeping up with the down and the jets are playing tough defense of late ranking in allowed per game over the last four weeks still though rich a pretty much sure starter unless loaded at same wr tim brown you might roll the dice on andre james brown is the man te ricky dudley is likely worth a start just but incredibly frustrating like i needed to tell the bay passing game vs lion defense not only must the lions defense the field without star cb they also have to face the cold weather where invincible check the for this one as it could be more than just cold good freezing outside but trying to throw the ball in a driving snowstorm entirely different matter will be throwing to wr bill i think is the better wr choice over bucks antonio freeman always worth a look a nice surprise catching the ball york jets passing game vs raider defense two teams see made of square off in a sunday night the raiders are the pass ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the weeks vinny to have finally gotten wr wayne be handled by charles but be fine fb racks up receiving totals and he could have a good day week te anthony continues to play well and is really coming england passing game vs chicago defense star on the a player to think if a defensive the bears thinking better go out and prove some that think finished chicago plays tough pass defense ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four week will look for wr terry the suddenly red hot troy rod down the te spot i davis gets a td as i love to write his passing game vs bills defense peyton still a in most leagues but you should know facing a tough this he struggled a bit last time these teams met with a season low passing although he did have marvin of clear cut guy it looks like terrence finally of his slump and could be a contributor again both ken played up to their potential of late even with game last week against miami the bills still rank over the week in passing yards allowed per bay passing game vs miami defense start your passing against the dolphins sam madison and patrick just down especially a like king not healthy to being just an adequate johnson is almost a start just for the showmanship but not excited about the ball passing game vs cowboy defense brad taken last snap as a redskin especially after he suggested done big armed jeff the helm likely face a the run and teams just choose to run all over them look davis to wear it out when george does throw i think james the best option albert likely start but plenty of plays te stephen probably worth a shot as catching fb larry diego passing game vs raven defense company get of facing the ranked defense over the past weeks in passing allowed per game it should be interesting leaf will be te freddie wr curtis jeff graham suffered a mouth last week and may need dental surgery probably just as well is looking very sketchy for passing game vs jaguar defense this could get ugly all ranks over the last four weeks in passing yards allowed and jake nursing bad ribs we saw with last week that hard for a team to keep a in the game if injured ribs david playing well lately and frank sanders awful not excited about any of them for this
