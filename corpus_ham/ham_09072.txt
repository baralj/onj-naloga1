pleased to announce that final acceptance has been received by our client from national gas company for the facilities built and performance tested by our project team thus completing the final major milestone on what must be considered to be one of most successful contracted as one project the work had to be managed as four distinct jobs the prime site at jose consists of a grassroots fractionation plant plus refrigerated storage the being contained entirely within existing live plant had to be built entirely under permitting system in addition the site was under constant threat of disruptive action by very vocal and active unionized workers thanks to the negotiating skills of our site manager tony burke they were shutdown only as much as three projects the secondary sites at santa barbara and san contained two grassroots propane extraction plants not only did their remoteness cause significant logistical problems for equipment also both had significant labour relations problems peculiar to their own locations san suffered many days of force majeure delay the disruptive action by several local community groups protesting all the impediments of the local labour logistics and the usual customs clearance issues the construction was essentially finished on and startup brought new challenges with erratic feedstock qualities testing both the design and the expertise of our startup crews a tribute to both that all performance tests were passed within hours of receiving a reasonably stable supply and the design flow rates and that the plants have remained online since or available with minimal hiccups generating significant income for our project tony burke andy dennis bill johnson and the rest of the team at site in houston and from for achieving a

looking for similar to everyone on the team for their signs first dry bulk shipping freight origination deal japanese shipping freight team has signed a time charter deal for a tonne vessel with lepta shipping with a performance guarantee from co tokyo japan the agreement has a notional value of million and a value of million the new agreement gives the option to buy the vessel in japanese yen after the third year and the time charter period itself can be extended by us by up to an additional four years if required the agreement takes effect from the latter part of when the ship itself currently being manufactured in the shipyard in japan or any similar substitute vessel becomes available we are already in the process of the first three years of our time charter above the curve announces pierre who heads dry bulk freight team this deal gives us a strategic long days position and we now expect to close further deals as a result of our drive to more time charter transactions

will also have the ability to buy additional protection similarly if the desks contract with the japanese terminates earlier the desk can sell back any unused cover to needed to increase our credit

commercial group having to optimise its capital at risk the services and tools credit has on offer are an excellent complement to our already sophisticated process commented ted of in go to andrew who
