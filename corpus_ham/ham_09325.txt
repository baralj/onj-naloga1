it may be standard practice in your opinion but kelly bill and i have never heard of this or remember it happening to us also was completely surprised by it as well we just cant understand why you would call a reduction in a withdrawal an injection your allocation is limiting storage injections and we were not making an injection wed like to know where to find this in the tariff so we can read it and understand it better we pulled looked at the am process instructions on the web and it doesnt say anything about is really upsetting to us is were thought we were set up fine to be in compliance with the and suddenly we couldnt do what we thought we had a right to do even though hot tap accepted the nomination on top of that no one from called us to let us know that our nomination had been undone and the same thing would have happened to us on the gas day if we hadnt been lucky enough to have found it on our own we pushed the gas across to but we are going to incur penalties from them as a result the other really strange thing is that during the processes we can cut back on our withdrawal even though storage is allocated but you cant do it at am it just doesnt make any sense to i am sorry and are experiencing allocation problems standard procedure during a storage injection allocation the up process does not allow withdrawal reductions or many other shippers are also working hard to manage other than getting truer information on your markets finding alternate markets for your excess capacity i dont have ideas on how to address your zone requested i will add this item to our december meeting should know that we are unhappy about something else now for gas day you did not let us reduce our to zero in the am process like normal because of a allocation because of this is going to get hit with penalties who handles the was this as well and may incur penalties werent trying to make an injection we were just trying to cut to zero we always schedule a maximum withdrawal in because we are always at risk of a zone just like been seeing lately weve had conference call with jean blair on the topic we are also in trouble now for the day which we are current trying to figure a way out of you this item to our discussion topics when you as indicated in my voice mail frank and i would like you to of alliant energy he would like someone to explain he is getting allocated at the zone level when he is trying his timely cycle noms later in the day to reflect and what are his alternatives especially as have a chance of being allocated please call jeff today he reached at natural email is the property of corp andor its relevant may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use intended recipient s any review use distribution or others is strictly prohibited if you are not the intended authorized to receive for the recipient please contact the reply to corp at all copies of the message this email and any are not intended to be an offer or an acceptance and do or evidence a binding and enforceable contract between or any of its affiliates and the intended recipient or any and may not be relied on by anyone as the basis of a contract or otherwise thank you
