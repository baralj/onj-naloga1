the team met yesterday and decided that there is no value and substantial risk to northern in accepting suggestion that we rewrite the measurement agreement to operate like the morgan scott city measurement agreement we are reluctant to incorporate the formula in any way beyond the limited purpose it serves under the current measurement agreement the following are talking points that dave will use today in a conversation with terry spencer who is steve boss since proposal which i sent to you by email last week was a draft and has never been formally sent to us we decided that having dave deliver our message to terry made more sense than sending a letter or elevating the issue to your and john gibsons level however if gibson calls you and raises the issue of their proposal the following points contain our may agree in the call with dave to reconcile the april and may imbalance based on our metered numbers if not britt has prepared a demand letter that can be sent at any time to get resolution of that issue rolling i believe that gibson indicated that hed be calling you back this week to talk about this matter so your conversation should take place before we send the demand letter ill forward the demand letter for your review the other proposal from that i forwarded to you last week relating to operational changes designed to allow to get the helium plant running again we have made some minor modifications and are sending the counterproposal back to we expect to get that deal in place with them soon this is a good development for them and with little or no risk to us and should temper any disappointment they feel because of our rejection of their give me a call if you have any questions or concerns thanks steve suggested approach is similar to scott city measurement agreement with kinder morgan it uses as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds that structure is very different from the measurement procedures agreement which as reaffirmed by the arbitrators does not make the numbers from northerns ultrasonic meters subject to numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a btu measurement error ie when the chromatograph northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to aga quality specifications independent outside experts and click confirmed this fact during the can currently use or any other means it wants to determine whether to call a special test of the accuracy of northerns ultrasonic meters pursuant to section of the measurement upon calling a special test any concerns may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters has not called for a special test but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are if wants to renegotiate the measurement procedures agreement to track the structure of the scott city procedure must bring its measurement and processes within the plant up to aga quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those the current imbalance at the plant is about million owed to based on northerns meters the outstanding imbalance situation at the plant which dates to april and may of this year must be resolved irrespective of what desires to do going forward since has not called a special test of northerns meters the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months if does not agree to that reconciliation northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies
