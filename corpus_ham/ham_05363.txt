image image before the big brown who covers texas football for the dallas morning your questions about the recruits and commitments and more inside ut football appears on to chip brown talk about the longhorns colleges is so much information being pumped out this week surrounding here is some of what both schools are releasing to texas taking bragging rights over the after a record decade the aggies won nine or more games eight times and or five times in the they are touting their victories in the as more than any in any single decade the former record for wins in a decade was royal and fred texas teams in the texas texas christian texas fans on the other hand can probably take comfort in the q ted five practices during which ut worked on the plan right knee appears to be responding pretty well he for the first time since getting injured at texas tech mack if is healthy enough to back up he would on a basis those situations would seem getting hurt or being completely ineffective for to play most or all of fridays cedric benson cotton think hell have a good chance of playing early because kenny and victor ike did not overwhelm the coaches this season but will be coming off of a redshirt season too and hell probably say in how much playing time anyone are out ss lee jackson hamstring and major knee for am lb jason glenn knee the aggies leader in sacks wr robert ferguson ankle and cb sammy davis ankle both did tuesday for the aggies and were listed as made a mistake by having the players take the game so lightly like we dont hate and its just another game on and b is that the attitude that will prevail going into and in future joe say that they are treated with respect make no mistake they jobs are on the line every day in practice they know if they in practice they will be replaced but ss greg brown said that has never given a hell hath no fury locker room talk before after a game greg brown said that mack simply states whats on the each game and expects the players to find their own way to mack has said that as well he said he asks players what he has said constant yelling wears off so he doesnt play with his team according to coaches and players from his time as coordinator back in mack used to be a much more of coach yelling at players to get them going coach barry switzer tone him down brown said he has learned that you cant be negative that you have to treat them with respect i dont know that you him talk about hating other an area of need not being addressed it appears that this is quite of offensive linemen so it looks like a lot of redshirts in the he signs what will quan be asked to do doesnt he have a and is that a factor on where he signs when all is said and do you think this class will rank come signing day in february of the potential not orally committed will most that rank ends up also with sneezy coming off a redshirt from what i am reading an impressive one at that what do you see in for cedric benson what about the returning such as ivan et al is the abundance of talent at a good thing or roy so you can never have enough of those positions ut is filling nicely with the commitments that it has the player that can the biggest difference is harris of killeen perhaps defensive tackle in the country uts class is shaping up as a top again if harris comes it will climb but as is the case of this recruiting hype its just that hype who knows if will play next year he has to come down here in the heat of prove to the coaches that hes better than kenny ivan ike and sneezy i would say chances are good if those guys dont toughen up and let loose but time will tell as far looking to transfer there arent any rumblings yet stay road uniforms longhorn football team has the ugliest uniform in all of when the horns play on the road they have too much white and color they wear the ugliest black football shoes and those long socks are atrocious it looks like each player can dress anyway there is no uniformity in the look some players dont even at all it seems coaches let each player express their own individuality and i like a bunch of individuals instead of as a team coach trend start and it has continued through the current regime with the orange home jerseys are not the right color orange and cheap i wish coach brown would adopt a true burnt orange color i would change the helmets to the same burnt orange color with a longhorn logo on each side and a white be tucked in and each player should be dressed the same of individuality should be allowed the longhorns look ragtag on the field if they would improve their image their play as well john robert waco to their own opinion i dont know about the burnt orange might be a little too much of a good we tend to compete for the same players and that they had their the cotton bowl since they were the home team t franks austin territory at least for the or so recruits the longhorns to get orally committed namely harris the defensive tackle killeen texas needs to take care of business on friday to sooners from stepping up their pitch for some of the noncommitted kids hoping to i understand that the horns were crushed against and also loss against stanford on the road but even with the those two losses the horns have one of the nations top plus we are playing at home and are riding the confidence of derrick jackson of respect comes from but i think people are lukewarm about ut longhorns havent had a chance to show how much theyve improved quality opponent until now the longhorns need to go out and grind into the ground to get the nations attention and i think they predicting texas jammer of running backs namely also keep an eye on against robert ferguson lewis basically said this week hit in the mouth hell fold so that immediately inspires in that jammer also had a lot to say about that if ankle wasnt percent it might not even be a close hes percent or percent that wont cut it jammer said say that he thought a healthy ferguson was better than kansas state morgan jammer and ferguson are both big roughly and be fun to out the ball and not being able stephen hype about building a passing offense the past several finally hit college station the aggies run even have trick plays and robert ferguson bethel johnson and chris receivers and mark farris is the gritty percent passer they have been looking for i think it will be a for texas owner of the nations no pass efficiency intercepted for margie throw it out of the playbook were not that dumb that was tuesday night on his radio getting the chance to pull the longhorns out of a hole a pick for a td really seemed to give him a positive jolt would have been pulled at that point for major at least have been pulled early in the season a la the chance to play an entire game seemed to help i believe be fine on friday he must feel good about his deep ball to roy the success they had at kansas i would expect to see a lot more creating room for mitchell to run against a depleted coming into this game that doesnt seem brock met including this year both have been ranked only nine times are and if you received this newsletter from a friend and
