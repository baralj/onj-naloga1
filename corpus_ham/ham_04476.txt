i jump into this i want to take one moment and say to men and women served our country as we approach saturday if you know a vet thank him or her i want to views but for those interested included a quick piece our veterans at the end of this report to avoid and game heres how i see the this week exactly where i rank to determine who to start just may be more favorable than another that doesnt id start the player with the best the info is be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by info the fantasy points allowed by position numbers are city passing game vs defense virtually every skill is a decent start against the but understand that last week elvis for more yards than randall and stewart combined san francisco stop and i envision them learning how this week san more fantasy points to the opposing than any other team in the kc are a mess and coach gunther says they as much but he says that every week derrick alexander and great plays te tony be big too have a chief start him this passing game vs raider defense for the year the raiders pretty weak against the pass averaging fantasy points allowed opposing which ranks them but over the last four weeks awful letting opposing offenses rack up an average of per game the most in the league granted two of were against the suddenly pass happy chiefs but there were also seattle and san diego in that average as well elvis set last week torching the secondary for yards and brian have success as well he continues to play excellent good decisions most importantly he has a healthy keep the defense honest ed smith are as both are liable to explode at any time the are trickier as they have three who figure heavily in the mix dwayne chamberlain clark all rank in the top over three weeks tough to count on any one of them but if you had one had catches last passing game vs defense it supposed to this way for seattle but as we enter week of the season the themselves floundering not only are they having trouble their defense is giving up entirely too many points cb is a player but the defense has allowed an average of per game over the last four weeks that ranks them in they rank in the league when it comes to fantasy to the opposing for the year certainly but this could be a game that mark some damage a week to prepare wr jimmy listed as probable on the this week reportedly be ready by sunday but keep an be ready i keep trying to like rookie r but just do it he could do something but i have yet te kyle suddenly the jacksonville secret weapon and play a big part again in the orleans passing game vs panther defense last year it was st year the saints are the once awful team playing defense has allowed an average of passing game over the last four weeks that ranks them theyve been as for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to the jeff coming off a td yard game last week continue to roll wr joe the prime receiver as he reeled yards worth of passes sunday keith the other to take up the slack for injured wr jake reed but been wr willie jackson caught passes sunday and he to see action te andrew very good sunday and that might come on francisco passing game vs chief defense the chiefs have no problem the ball unfortunately for chief fans they also have no the other team throw the ball kansas city ranks in allowed per game over the last four weeks they also rank points allowed by the opposing for the year all that solid day for jeff keep a very close eye on toe though reports are that play sunday but can be ugly and hard to recover from so watch this one you jerry as solid as ever on the other side if is tai streets would see more action personally streets of those two charlie always a threat ball and te greg a hint of being more involved last passes cheering for him but i expect be a factor for the passing game vs jets defense whether you want to lay it opponents or not hard to deny the jets defense has slipped for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and over the last four weeks allowed an average yards per game which puts them at given up over those four games which is more than expect from them face a colt team been challenged by coach jim mora to kick up the intensity again last week seemed to be going through the motions for the first half and a mad dash at the end last week manning ran out of tricks in the they were humiliated by chicago he still finished with yards could have been even better i like the way rallying the team again he should be looking to wr marvin harrison after harrison tough to call as spreading the ball around eg both saw action for some reason terrence as he only had a couple of passes thrown his way and of them pollard were their usual tough to predict selves and of course a solid outside of harrison and james a gamble for who will any of these guys are probably worth a start if thin york giants passing game vs rams defense two very good teams going different directions the rams are dealing with adversity two best players while the giants are regaining some of their steam rejuvenated kerry collins will face a st louis defense still yielding lots of passing yards in fact they rank in yards allowed per game over the last four weeks they rank points allowed to opposing for the year wr amani the owners who hung with him through the rough games as hes fire lately ike is a fine wr as well tiki barber provide a solid running threat and te pete mitchell more than he has louis passing game vs giant defense new york is a good team and tough against the giants new york ranks in allowed to opposing this year and they rank in allowed over the last four weeks plus theyll be getting cb back this week it appears trent green has done an admirable in for kurt warner im betting hell continue that success bruce is the hell bring hakim and the fold as well all are viable starters te roland williams is play but hes inconsistent throw in the fact theyll likely a lot without marshall and i think theyll do bay passing game vs packer defense green bay may have salvaged with antonio spectacular catch monday night but they a pass defense that gives up too many yards for the year they in fantasy points allowed to opposing and over the last four allowed passing yards per game which also ranks them king continues to post nice numbers even if theyre not real his last three games hes thrown but has only rolled up still that ranks him among hes been diagnosed of thursday after complaining of expected but watch it of course his favorite wr is now johnson private meeting at kings house a couple of weeks ago with getting the ball to johnson so dont look for that to green is a solid wr and the better deep threat te dave moore more active catching a td last york jets passing game vs colt defense owners of jim to think it was all miller last week as he ripped through the truthfully the colts porous pass defense had plenty to do vinny should have similar success the colts rank yards allowed per game over the last four weeks but that up a decent amount of yardage to less than juggernauts chicago new england and seattle wayne and rookie coles should do well te anthony is finally starting expectations hes probable on the injury report with a knee should be able to passing game vs bear defense the bears have played decent of late ranking in passing yards allowed over the last peyton manning rolled up yards against them last week and several badly dropped passes the bills will reportedly start doug hes a foot shorter than manning but brings scrambling ability may have a tough time with te jay is back to the we all thought hed be and that should continue eric moulds is threat at wr with peerless price and jeremy rounding out id think and moulds will get the bulk of the work passing game vs bills defense if im cade im starting very worried new jim miller looked very good sunday as he went with yards td and interceptions thats a great have a tough go of it this week there could be enough the buffalo that chicago can sneak in the bills are in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks target will again be wr robinson hes big enough to match with the bills after harrison it gets hard to predict with and marty booker catching plenty of balls te a little more involved each week i keep looking for him to big passing game vs denver defense the raider attack is firing on here denver ranks in passing yards allowed over the weeks they rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing year in their week rich threw but had yardage total of the year and had interceptions since then wr tim brown is the primary guy of course but both and james may make plays im not totally into the as hes not getting tons of looks although he is making the very what hes getting te ricky dudley awoke from his slumber with hes so frustrating but hes too talented in too good not to play unless you have another great passing game vs bengal defense the bengals rank in allowed over the last four weeks theyre in fantasy to opposing what an injury list the cowboys have troy took the needle again this week with more cortisone shots back is it just me or is he looking more and more like nick in dallas each week the are hardly recognizable with wayne and jason tucker carrying the load im not about any of them te jackie harris could be the focal point passing england passing game vs brown defense keep an eye on this one as on drew right thumb hes still listed as well know more friday and saturday assuming hes ok this is still if sits and john starts this probably a downside the browns rank in fantasy points allowed and they rank in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks wr terry struggled some of late but this could game he takes advantage of the cleveland secondary troy brown is passes as well the patriots havent thrown to the te since ben passing game vs cardinal defense suddenly the vikings are human coach green says been a sore tailbone and knee thats hindering his mobility this week an arizona defense that ranks in passing yards allowed per the last four weeks they also face new coach dave a a reputation for designing defenses to confuse young they rank for the year in fantasy points allowed to opposing some of that doubt a reflection on their weak rushing defense but the cause important will be throwing to the usual culprits of and cris carter aeneas williams is fine corner but he cant both moss and carter are must starts as is to find a consistent passing game vs falcon defense lots of uncertainties as from a concussion in the wake of coach bobby ross quitting on a soapbox but between barry sanders bailing out on his team on of training camp and bobby ross throwing in the towel on a team with record in november i cant remember seeing two quitters on so prominently in a while im sure there are behind the involved but his resignation seemed awfully odd must be in that detroit water the falcons rank in passing yards per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank points allowed to opposing charlie batch will be throwing johnnie morton and herman moore who have both been te david sloan needs to pick up his game and he could be the allowing batch to get into a bay passing game vs buccaneer defense both teams seem to have way recently and want to keep the momentum rolling the rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks they rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing for the year brett a wily vet and hell be pulling out all the stops mondays game not just for the win but because seemed to be wr antonio freeman the ball more often thats great news for both bill is a factor too but freeman is clearly the wr bubba franks and tyrone davis still share enough time at te the other from being a major passing game vs saints defense the turnaround of the saints of the best stories of the season certainly their tough much credit against the pass new orleans ranks just yards allowed over the last four games theyre much the rush for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed steve is certainly not the version we saw still a pretty good donald hayes and muhammad will make plays they have a decided height advantage over new orleans weary and kevin in the absence of te wesley walls will likely get the start if kris cant passing game vs viking defense if youre in contention in week plummer as your congratulations youre one heck of a manager jake plummer fan but if youre going to play him this could be minnesota is improving on defense but theyre still susceptible big plays they rank in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks david boston is injured with a bad hamstring and wednesday frank sanders is in a huge slump even by his is saying something may be the best wr on the now enough passing game vs charger defense quietly the dolphins and are winning football games probably isnt winning them your fantasy team though he faces the chargers this week who are playing a little bit more like the chargers of old san diego ranks fantasy points allowed by opposing for the year but they rank in yards allowed per game over the last four weeks will be to and leslie shepherd tony martin is expected action as well may continue to play well but the chargers on defense diego passing game vs dolphin defense charger coach mike riley moses will get the start at at least with had an experienced behind center the dolphins rank in allowed per game over the last four weeks but for the year in fantasy points allowed to opposing i think theyll to their year long numbers this week will throw to jones primarily and even with the hes too good it remains to be seen if will lock onto jones did in game where played times which is less than his normal curtis and are up and down players and probably not starters in most passing game vs jaguar defense with brock set back in his recovery from a concussion it looks like jon gets start the situation is very worrisome to me hes to be having this type of problem usually it seems like its guys like and chandler that have trouble shaking the cobwebs like it jacksonville ranks in fantasy points allowed this year over the last four weeks they rank in allowed per game will spread the ball between derrick jackson likely as sean is battling a deep quad might be a factor but he looks to be limited right now te caught just pass last week but it was for a td so to consider him titan passing game vs raven defense steve throwing the ball with a healthy bunch of he doesnt close to a healthy bunch of kevin is gone is gone without technically leaving carl is hobbled and derrick mason is less than looks like more receptions for imagine that the ravens are suddenly inspired with finally breaking the scoreless streak and they could be passing game vs steeler defense in case you havent steelers are an excellent football team theyd be hard to handle they had a theyre defense is all were concerned about here pretty darn good they rank in passing yards allowed over the weeks they also rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing doesnt bode well for donovan hell attempt to throw small and charles johnson small is actually starting to get but it probably wont matter te chad lewis hasnt been nearly as he was early and i dont look for him to rebound in this passing game vs lion defense this one could get ugly as looks to miss the game as he recovers from a concussion sunday danny gets the start hell lion pretty solid and ranked in passing yards allowed over the weeks with throw to and tim dwight played very well of late but could struggle against a lion defense be looking to exhibit some of that post coach firing enthusiasm kelly shows nice flashes here and there but needs to be passing game vs titan defense the ravens exploded last week td department ending their much publicized drought that against the bengals whod have a tough time stopping the university much less baltimore im guessing the ravens find the going tad bit rougher against a solid tennessee defense the titans rank yards allowed over the last four weeks and in fantasy by opposing for the year trent gets the and patrick are the with travis taylor injured reserve but te shannon is the primary threat the red zone hes probably the only raven id feel good about passing game vs patriot defense the browns are tough to doug bless his heart seems to try awfully hard but it takes more than trying to succeed at this level against a crafty like bill great at confusing the it might be good thing about is that he does seem to rely on wr almost exclusively hes not a bad play if you need a wr you know hell see the you wonder how cb law rookie wr dennis has talent the bengals peter is stuck in a bad situation te aaron a passing game vs eagle defense the eagle steeler game looks a slugfest as both defenses should manhandle the offenses in passing yards allowed per game over the last four stewart that number ought to look even better the eagles rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing for stewart will try to throw the ball to and ward but i wouldnt hold my breath te mark last week but i wouldnt expect that too passing game vs dallas defense lets put it this way may be the best on this team the bengals face a thats got its back against the wall with a near comical series of the bengals may be just what the cowboys need for taking out smith will face a defense thats ranked yards allowed per game over the past four weeks smith will ball to peter and craig yeast this team just doesnt veterans to show these guys who to act a great talent worth a start as you never know what hell do but its a for him te tony is tough to depend onrushing game heres how i see the this week see the online for exactly where i rank players and who to start just because one may be more favorable that doesnt necessarily mean id start the player with the the info is meant to be just one more tool in your it comes to deciding between tyrone napoleon vs bronco defense one thing last week its to listen to jon last week all he talked about was how limited be and that would carry the load we know how this week will be even worse with monday night ill get you of info that i hear but i can already see its going to be tough his ankles making it worse is the fact denver has given up tons yards they rank in rushing yards allowed over but of course the corey romp skews that a bit for the rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing robert smith vs cardinal defense new coach dave given the team a boost but he was the defensive coordinator for one worst rush defenses in the league before he moved to the head ranks in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks still learning the game and likely to face some from look for smith to be relied jr and kevin vs brown defense jr been a nice surprise after a slow start hes shown nice power kevin has seemingly settled into the down role suits him better cleveland hasnt stopped anyone on the ground rank for the year in fantasy points allowed to opposing in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks i never comfortable predicting what bill will do but id will see the bulk of the work fred taylor vs defense seattle ranks points allowed to opposing for the year its even worse they rank in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks for fred taylor to have a nice game as the jaguars try to season theyre on the brink of missing the playoffs and id tom to focus on what he loves best the corey vs cowboy defense the baltimore game last isnt superman but this is a great for him stopped anyone on the ground ranking in rushing yards the last four weeks they rank in fantasy points allowed i worry about the bengal passing game or lack of it still should be able to charlie garner vs chief defense the chiefs rank points allowed to opposing this season theyre in allowed per game over the last four weeks that has to have owners licking their chops hes cooled a bit from his red hot this could be the game he gets back on james stewart vs falcon defense atlanta comes into week in fantasy points allowed to opposing they rank yards allowed over the last four weeks this could be boost the lions need after the bobby ross resignation and with chris chandler likely out the lions have a chance this anderson vs lion defense this could be a running the lions arent much better than the falcons defending ranking in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks has been fairly quiet this season with chris chandler theyll need him to carry the offensive orleans ricky williams vs panther defense carolina ranks yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and that number be worse once ricky williams is through with them hes running power and aggression everyone hoped for last season i think is not only his health but a solid passing offense to take off him travis prentice vs patriot defense new england only ranks rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing prentice and offense have struggled but this could be a decent been thinking about playing smith vs bengal defense cincinnati ranks in allowed to opposing they rank in rushing yards the last four weeks with their and decimated by injuries like itll be almost by default id look for dallas to to carry the load this jerome vs eagle defense the eagles rank yards allowed over the last four weeks for the season theyre better than that ranking in fantasy points allowed to has been a nice surprise this season but it looks like hell starting center dawson and thats a ricky and alexander vs jaguar defense over four weeks jacksonville ranks in rushing yards allowed per the season they rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing not very jaguar like and you know theyre dying to get it the big worry for owners is that coach mike to next year and gives alexander more time be careful bays and mike vs packer defense green in with the defense for rushing yards allowed per game over four weeks for the year theyre in fantasy points allowed its tough to predict how coach tony dungy will use his has been carrying the ball more than usual lately but youd think like to get into more of a grind it out mode with big guy has to prove he can hold onto the york jets curtis martin vs colts defense defenses have keyed martin lately while they take their chances with been pretty effective as martins not made much noise im not colts can contain him though they rank in rushing yards the last four weeks with martin and james on the be a of two great sammy morris and shawn vs bear defense chicago ranks rushing yards allowed over the past four weeks with doug center id look for continued running from morris and to put up similar fantasy numbers if i had to pick one id with james vs jets are looking from a sub par performance last week id think see and more of a reliance on james instead of manning having the jets rank inrushing yards allowed over the last james is a must start with his potential in all facets of the michael thomas jones vs viking an eye as he seems to have a habit of finding some sort of injury to the viking defense they rank in rushing yards over the last four weeks dave reportedly the ball into hands more although jones is the paid the big money to so you have to wonder how long hell smith vs charger defense for the season san diego ranks in fantasy points allowed to opposing theyve been tougher i like the way smith is running with confidence id start hesitation this bays green vs buccaneer defense with out turns to green he seems to be anxious and ready to contribute in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks so itll be for the year tampa ranks in fantasy points allowed hes got skills though and could do lewis vs titans defense tennessee comes into week in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing theyre quick and athletic and should be a good match for lewis id expect less than his normal production from city vs defense san francisco has been fairly soft run ranking in rushing yards allowed the past four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed by opposing but all faith in gunther and his running game theyve everyone getting the ball to nobody getting the ball while elvis all day i like anders but id avoid all kc if you vs miami defense seems to be the the week for san diego as he ran for yards on carries last a lot for a charger the dolphins are tough against the ranking over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed even without lb zach thomas itll be a tough is a sure starter this is just a tough for him over four weeks oakland ranks in rushing yards allowed per game davis to do well hes just got his work cut out for york giants tiki barber and ron vs rams defense the rams tougher against the run lately where they rank in rushing over the last four weeks their offense continues to force pass the ball the giant have been very effective though so count them out coach seems more willing to use ron situations than he did early on and barber is a great the louis justin watson vs giants defense the giants rank in points allowed for the year to opposing and in rushing over the past four weeks in other words theyre tough been tough justin watson will have had more time to prepare start this week but i dont think this is an gary for type situation where the guy steps in easily and performs well as the guy marshall does too much in that also be spelled likely by but ill believe it when that on the field robert could see some time at james allen curtis vs bills defense the bills play defense ranking over the last four weeks in rushing yards game they rank for the year in fantasy points allowed by this will be a tough for any bear that carries the vs saints defense new orleans ranks the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game folks down and i dont think the carolina running game is to buck that trend this eddie george vs raven defense eddie george is a must hes healthy this week i just dont like the against tough raven defense thats ranked in rushing yards allowed over weeks hell grind out some yards but itll be vs steeler defense may have had week but this week he hits a roadblock in the steeler ranks for the year in fantasy points allowed for i dont that will change after this is a a certain look in the eye
