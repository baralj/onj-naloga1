we get on being in the playoff hunt thats something to be you have to be a little bit lucky to get this far but dont hesitate yourself on the back as skill plays a huge part judging from tons of you are still in mix dont forget about our wall feature where well showcase league winners stay tuned for more crunch time so lets jump right into our upgraded and as we head down the final weekend for many teams players moving up or down can be the difference fantasy bowl or just finishing in the money as we head into our of listing these players inevitable that some guys will the upgrade or downgrade list make sure you understand what about is players that are moving in other words a player like dudley could appear on the downgrade list and still be good enough a starter in your league it just means concerned about the to be heading likewise a player like wr willie jackson may make list even though still fairly far down the list of about which direction players are moving keeping an eye on these as they can very often make all the and downgrades some of these players are obvious moves up and some arent as clear heres my list of guys i see moving moving jeff sf poster boy jeff continues no coincidence that returned with a vengeance this donovan phi mixed emotions here as ive been hyping as the guy carrying the eagles offense but seeing him on roster in the playoffs yesterday was less than for and yards just be aware the eagles are off and wont return till week jon sea like mike maybe ive been too critical he continues to play well and while it likely wont be in looks like a starter for some team in aaron brooks no a telling mark of a great is how he performs comes with less than his a game brooks looked much less in and clearly struggled at times making a few bad throws and receivers yet he hung in and still posted outstanding numbers rushing yards quietly add to the points hes a player im with few kerry collins you have to believe his confidence is sky high benefited from the return of ike who looked very team is looking very tough and very balanced right now the is just good enough to be a real worry for the defense but not that it hurts the mark its really weird when the hype finally this guy he starts delivering fantasy numbers worthy of hype kurt warner this may have been the greatest performance in of the league without scoring a td the guy was of his passes of completing with an average yards is sick the will come as warner looked as good as seen him placing the ball perfectly and directing his ray keep an eye on groin better yet watch reports for news on groin thats better we should soon but if its serious will get the moving marshall i know you dont need me to list him here but noting i think he may be the best player in the league right fed him the ball times and he eddie george ten george showed outstanding pass receiving skills receiving to go with his rushing td he reinjured his sore looks to be ok keep an eye on it fred taylor what a shocker taylor runs wild again as he did tweak a knee so watch that but if he can go full a no brainer starter against just about james allen chi if departed offensive coordinator gary dont get excited bears fans hes not hed be spinning in his see allen garner carries sunday be a little leery though as a carry average only works when you carry the ball a travis prentice after fading badly prentice comes roaring a td performance he only had yards on attempts but the huge the brown offense featured some crazy looks with kevin at but they looked much mike anderson den what else can you say the denver ol is pro bowl season anderson is a must start vs any team right green im very nervous if im right been an offensive stalwart carrying the load week after always knew he had the potential to be this good but now smith dal as was mentioned on the broadcast yesterday to tell the redskins this game is a rivalry you know the in particular had to enjoy humiliating the redskins it would bold move even for him but i wouldnt be surprised in the least to fire terry before his obligatory three games are lewis bal once again lewis rolls over the opponents and look bad for him this summer against the cardinals this has the chance to be even tb if had any help the would scary hes doing it all by himself which probably isnt a bad thing tony richardson kc richardson netted on carries looks to have cartilage damage to his knee so increase its a shame someone has to get hurt for to give richardson more car dont hold your breath but noises about returning to the lineup this week well terry allen no in a lesser version of ol it appears can run effectively behind these guys allen looked and should only get better as he gets familiar with the chris warren phi remember that hes off this week but if your through week he could be a moving sean sea is quietly posting some very as is jon is drawing a lot of looks and his small charles johnson phi look what donovan when his decide to show up if they can continue to play well could be scary remember theyre off this week but return in week amani of the resurging giants leading hes making plays all over the field and even had a nice run sf the scary part is he could have been even better yard td performance sunday he looked very good coming the toe injury and should only get better the are trying down their wr corps for and is making a ed den its easy to get excited whenever he outplays but the truth of the matter is that theyre both excellent and his grade shoulder pads hes the when it comes to pads or lack thereof easy ed goes with the helmet and pee wee shoulder pads and thats it oh yeah hes great darrell jackson sea jackson made the upgrade list last week i see few reasons why he wont continue to holt its tough to predict which ram wr will catch from warner but as i said several weeks ago holt may be the best the team and thats no sleight to isaac bruce holts that terry glenn ne putting together one of his most and continuing to play pretty good football which willie jackson no catch td you gotta like a guy who gets the point joe horn is the clear threat but jackson is a germane det this didnt look like a guy returning from leg he should continue to get better as he becomes more involved flow of bobby shaw pit it seems hard to believe but bobby shaw is starter in many leagues hes getting lots of looks and are throwing the ike looked well rested as he roared back scene an sprained knee suffered by joe will likely playing time even donald hayes car hayes looked better as expected and turned in a catching passes for yards the panthers need to remain if they can hayes could moving johnny min again was active catching yards i like any receiver on this andrew glover no glovers starting to become a very integral part new orleans passing game its hard to imagine this team jeff blake and cam kris car hes no wesley walls but hes more than greg clark sf he only had yards but the receptions were a moving scott mitchell the clock struck midnight as mitchell became the we remembered this team is pretty much corey and a roll of with peter for his big play jeff george was ive gotta say im really surprised george didnt some great numbers albert isnt nearly as good as he thinks is and that may be part of the steve car its clear to everyone that was a career hes still subject to a great game here and there but hes just too to lean very heavily king tb this guy just isnt very charlie batch det ive never been a big charlie batch fan certainly had his days he looked a bit lost at times sunday losing herman moore wont help although german is troy dal i hope does himself a favor and gives steve a call a sore back is one thing not remembering your kids an entirely different matter its not worth it leaf sd part of it was baltimore a large part of it was jay mia suffered a torn rotator cuff on his non shoulder the dolphins will make a decision wednesday likely itll be or this week at suffered a groin injury that may or be serious hes not getting any younger though so keep an eye on moving ron its just hard to get excited about starting this guy hes such a risk to be taken out of the hes always liable that short yardage td but you just dont know when or where theyll jerald moore fa things change quickly in this league a few moore looked to be the now hes phi id expect that chris warren will cut into his when they white travis prentice carried the load while white brad hoover car he came back to reality this week on top of looks like his days may be numbered as looks to return this moving herman moore det moore neck stinger sunday he give way to germane who looked very good returning from tai streets sf conventional wisdom had streets seeing more action tried to see what they had for but with the return of it looks like streets will be courtney hawkins pit hes losing time to bobby shaw the steeler to be pretty well set with ward and danny farmer farmer had made a little noise pushing for a spot peter but it doesnt look like its going to make any stokes sf like tai streets stokes suffers from the return of sylvester morris kc morris continues his regression which should flags as owners look towards johnson tb with king struggling i dont see a for ahead he sounds like a politician conceding when of the team finding its identity in running the moving anthony in the up and down season from anthony it like hes headed down a bit the injury to affects his in a negative tony not that was carrying many ff teams but he a broken jeff phi looks like chad lewis has resumed his role as the david dal between injuries to himself and troy was limited and it looks like it may not be changing anytime
