eric bass this is a simple way to a nice calm happy life this is nice reading but short enjoy this is what the dalai lama has to say on the millennium all it takes is a few seconds to read and think it over do not keep this message the mantra must leave our hands within you will get a very pleasant surprise this is true even if you are not superstitious i n s t r u c t i o n s f o r l i f e take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk when you lose dont lose the lesson respect for self respect for others and responsibility for all your actions that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck learn the rules so you know how to break them properly dont let a little dispute injure a great friendship when you realize youve made a mistake take immediate steps to correct it spend some time alone every day open your arms to change but dont let go of your values remember that silence is sometimes the best answer live a good honourable life then when you get older and think back be able to enjoy it a second time a loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life in disagreements with loved ones deal only with the current situation dont bring up the past share your knowledge its a way to achieve immortality be gentle with the earth once a year go someplace youve never been before remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it approach love and cooking with reckless abandon forward this mantra email to at least people and your life will improve liking
