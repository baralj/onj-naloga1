you may remember in september john miller called to find out if we want to sell willow farms at that time i told him i would find out from the december he called again and we missed one another but i finally told via that we would entertain and consider and offer to buy willow farms but that we would not consider any kind of partnership or joint venture and we wanted a straight sale i then told him that if he was still interested that he should give it his best shot and we would consider whatever he sent discussion of the group is still interested in whatever he would propose but i wanted to make some things clear so he didnt think we were wasting his i told him that in reality all dont want to sell but out of do and i wont stand in the way of a satisfactory we still do not want to participate in any development or sale the price cannot be dependent on success of sales and a sale must be all or nothing i told him that i could not agree to any sale that allowed a cherry picking of good lots and left other lots behind because once sales started it puts pressure to complete the development or else all prices suffer under perception of undesirable i told him that the only reason we are having this discussion now is that due to the property tax revaluations the carrying costs of the lots has increased therefore any sale must be structured to take that carrying cost pressure off hence a sale of all or stating these ground rules i told him that i would understand if he wasnt interested but that if he was he should just give us his best then asked how many lots and i told him with a possible but owned only by my mom he said lets keep that out for now i also told him that within the next years the lot with the house might also be sold but that that was up to my he is interested too in reducing his risk so he might be interested in deal where he would guarantee the purchase of lots every year for years it would be a he asked me if we had any idea of the value we wanted for the lots i said there are different ideas and no consensus so i said i had no number to give him i reiterated to him that he knows more than me since im just a lawyer in denver and he should give it his best i told him that any deal that did not ensure sale of all lots was just not acceptable so the extent of his guarantee of lots per year had to be firm as to lots over years to even be considered i told him then it would appear just to be a means of financing the sale not reducing his risk and allowing us to keep title to the unsold lots rather than tie them up with a i told him that his proposal may not be worth considering if it allowed the kind of cherry picking i referred to above and the kind of pressure to pick up the remaining lots at lower prices that i referred to above i told him to consider these concerns in his i told him that because what brought us to the table now is the increased carrying costs of the lots any proposal by him that still puts pressure on us to carry these lots and expend finds will not be well received for example i told him that i have some concern that any lot per year deal will result in immediately increased carrying costs resulting from revaluation of the remaining lots for property tax purposes based upon the first purchases i told him that that would not be well received by we ended told him that i wanted to make clear my concerns so that he doesnt waste his time and feel resentful if we reject his offer i told him that i wanted to be above board and that my reputation was important to me he said he understood and appreciated the said he will put a proposal together and i told him to send it to leonard at the office since i am not good at being the me know if i goofed up or did
