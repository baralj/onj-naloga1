this is just one of the many that my i have been passing on throughout the last weeks just to get you in the mood michael aggies could you please extend a warm welcome to derrick johnson next week after all he will be the most talented lb to ever play on kyle field i wonder who the best ever to play on kyle field is ricky or earl that is such a hard question that its giving me a headache trying to figure it out i must say that the horns do not have the best punter to ever play on kyle field i watched the oakland game and that shane is a mighty fine punter graf dustin luis you are right as always can anyone tell me the last time this rivalry game had a line that suggests a blowout think about if it wasnt a rivalry and wasnt at the overrated kylie field the line would be at about at best you should feel lucky that vegas takes that into consideration unfortunately the texas longhorns do not we will treat just the same as we did colorado which beat you tech which also beat you etc and we will beat you by it is just like the vs wells rivalry sure it was a rivalry but it was never close in any sport because of talent well had heart but that can only take you so far eventually the talent starts to dominate until it has overcome your heart and taken all of your pride this is exactly what texas will do to their redheaded stepchild i dont know why the line is so low i guess that they think that your little stadium is going to scare us so bad that we will forget how to defend the reverse and the double reverse we have sent our players to local high school games to simulate the environment and the offense you will run against us i will take every part of that line for whatever price you want it will go up to at least by game time mark my words lastly i hope that we take it easy on f i would spell his last name but i dont know the spelling since i have never seen it in print i have heard from that he has a child i would really bother me for a young child to lose his father at such a young age and to see it in person unfortunately for you it will be hard to avoid you have no running game to speak of and that means that we will be blitzing all day i think that a good day for you would be yards of total offense i would have said less but it is a rivalry texas texas am your welcome for the three that will come with our head trainer at dustin graf international drive suite austin tx tel fax original message it is officially a great day when the are happy that the line came in below the dustin standards i would be proud too are we all going to downtown wed night i didnt think any self respecting aggie would take points from texas i guess covering the spread is a goal i am already on my bets this week the line for the game is listed at points below prediction the line will shrink to do you yahoo find the one for you at yahoo personals do you yahoo find the one for you at yahoo personals do you yahoo find the one for you at yahoo you the one for you at yahoo personals
