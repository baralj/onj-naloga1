of afghanistan this past week you may have noticed some deal dyn bid for and on monday the announcement of p proposed merger with to create the worlds oil merger is an excellent example of what economists call horizontal integration the merger of two companies in the same business in this case oil and gas as an investor i love these combinations even though as a citizen im often troubled by antitrust concerns investors in whats called merger arbitrage or risk arbitrage which gained fame and notoriety in the tend to sell stock in the acquiring company and buy the stock of the company being acquired though theyre far now risk play a prominent role in many hedge funds the strategy is appealing to many portfolio managers because returns are determined less by overall movement in the market than by the circumstances of particular deals successful hedge funds typically earn to a year in good markets and investors can do some risk arbitrage of their own simply by buying stock in a company being acquired and hoping the deal goes through because of the risk that it wont either because of regulatory hurdles or market reaction these stocks usually trade at a discount to the acquisition price but few investors are willing to commit the time and resources to keep up with every twist in these deals let alone investing in enough of them to have a reasonably diversified portfolio i know i for investors i often recommend buying the stock of the acquiring company in this latest instance that would be in similar circumstances i have had good luck buying exxon after it launched its bid for mobil to form exxon mobil and chevron after it acquired texaco to become their stocks were down on the news but later recovered handsomely as they began to benefit from and economies of scale not to mention reduced competition even if the deal fails you arent stuck owning a stock that was bid up only because a deal was announced hon investors will know only too well what i mean consider it outrageous that the european community blocked general electrics ge acquisition of but when the deal fell through were glad they had bought the acquiring company rather than the far the deal is unusual in that both stocks rose slightly after the merger was announced which suggests that other investors on to the same phenomenon ive noticed but even without a premium im enthusiastic about the energy sector true oil dropped further since i last recommended them before the calamitous events of sept with talk of an price war breaking out and dire predictions of oil its no wonder but its exactly in the oil patch look their worst that its the time to buy these stocks if there is indeed a global economic recovery next year as more likely oil prices will rise so i recommend both as a merger play and as a timely investment in the energy brings me to im glad i warned readers away from this former highflying pipeline and concern since its to fall precipitously until the takeover bid emerged from this isnt exactly a horizontal merger since isnt a big factor in energy trading but it will combine the two companies pipelines and holdings the market reaction to this deal was very unusual since shares of the acquiring company jumped on the news moved up just this is the opposite of whats supposed to happen but then nothing about has been typical the market seems to be saying that the deal but doubts it will go through a prospect enhanced by the large breakup fee will enjoy if its horrified by what it discovers in books personally im sitting this one out but there may be an arbitrage opportunity in for investors if the deal goes through and i think it will shareholders will receive share of for each share of thats worth over a share at current prices yet closed tuesday at just down a warning from the company that its falling credit ratings are starting to rattle its financial structure so while position is becoming increasingly precarious this deal could make for a nice return and potentially a very good bet for one that will add to its reserves and vault it into the front ranks of energy traders assuming it can hold on to talented but now disgruntled employees finally theres the spectacle of the founding and families turning against proposed acquisition of on the grounds that proposed economies of scale read layoffs run counter to the spirit of the founders who treasured employee loyalty and apparently never fired anyone except for cause the dissidents acknowledged that they have little or no business and managerial experience themselves although they are represented on board forgive me if i seem impatient with these beneficiaries of extravagant wealth and trust funds but this reasoning is much we might sympathize with their concern for employee wellbeing the directors of a modern corporation must balance employees needs of other constituencies especially the shareholders otherwise a company will suffer far more dire consequences including bankruptcy or a forced sale in which far more people will lose their jobs than in any layoffs i have already expressed my muted enthusiasm for the proposed merger that the deal was even proposed is a sad commentary on how far the fortunes of these companies have fallen that said the merger still makes sense and its far better for shareholders than if the companies are forced to continue in their respective downward spirals i owned both stocks until last week when i sold my small position in i did this primarily to realize a tax loss more on selling next week but also because i wouldnt want to own it if the deal falls through im holding on to my larger position in hp i think the deal will be completed despite the melodrama of family opposition eventually i believe both stocks will benefit and patient investors might want to buy one or both companies on any weakness ing success of the northern alliance and the american military mission in afghanistan has been an amazing story this past week who will soon forget the accounts of newly liberated afghans digging up their tv sets casting off their veils and celebrating their freedom from oppression the implications of this success are profound and in my view extremely positive economists are already scaling back their estimates for total cost of this war oil prices are plunging the effect is that of a significant tax cut and just when the economy needs it the capture of bin laden seems only a matter of time which means the world may soon be a safer place of greater stability in the middle east has never seemed more it a paradox that as a calamitous nears an end i feel more thankful than i have in years filled with a far greater bounty of peace and prosperity perhaps not i hope this thanksgiving brings you hope joy and gratitude for the many blessings that have been bestowed upon us and that have survived and even flourished in the wake of more information and analysis of
