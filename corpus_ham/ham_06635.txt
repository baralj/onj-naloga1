looks like we have our teams we will probably keep the same last year unless anybody has an objection still to be determined fees draft date and free agent pickup protocol i suggest that on august at the building on floor for those of cant make it you can draft over the internet we will be using again i think that will be me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date ie cant make early too not the look forward to a return to prominence this all do not stand a chance
