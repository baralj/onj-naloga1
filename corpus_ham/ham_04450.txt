image image goal post motivation brown who covers ut football for the dallas morning your questions about injuries chris bowl prospects and ut football appears on to chip brown talk about the longhorns colleges learning that the goal posts had been greased at texas tech to from tearing them down if the red raiders had beaten texas got some more goal post bulletin board material from texas coach mack brown told his team about a story that appeared in on oct about how kansas players hoped they tearing down the goal posts after beating texas this at the time players quoted in the article had hoped they would texas for their sixth win making them bowl eligible as it need to beat both texas and iowa still that didnt keep mack brown from telling his team about the i think thats insulting said ut cb jammer theyll only when it doesnt thats disrespectful said ut cb rod its the same thing as up the goal recalling that three teams missouri and oklahoma state tore posts after beating a ut team in coach mack brown called goal post on a related note brown is taking all kinds of measures to make his texas players wore jackets and head warmers in the cold and rain in oklahoma they will be without such comforts when they travel this weekend where temperatures could be in the when we played in the mist up in dallas the players had coats on and mack brown said weve taken those away we dont take jackets to anymore when its cold no masks nothing were going to go with helmets and play were not going to stand around and let the weather brown also wants his team to be up and ready despite playing to a likely be sparse at on there wont be anybody there brown said referring to the fact that averaged fans at home this largest crowd at memorial stadium capacity was state on oct q eligibility can he get a medical redshirt for his rick redshirt and thus have four years of eligibility after this rogers how many snaps has he been getting over the last several games point during the tech game i thought i saw adam and the field at the same time playing tackle i know these freshmen great but i figured either shawn or casey would always be field to give the line the benefit of their experience please provide of the tackle rotation dan ankle sprain has really taken a toll hes not the same player he the houston game still he wants to stay out on the field he is not percent and were out on the field tech for several plays several key plays mack brown said had the quickness to hold their own against offensive line i dont know how often see a tackle doesnt include casey but against tech the coaches felt have to play four defensive ends and four defensive tackles of the number of pass rushers needed to get pressure on the a running team you probably would see as part of the in the lars ligament in his right knee he is questionable for texas wr artie shin is out for saturday cb hill shoulder for the season and may need surgery dt shoulder is the season and has already undergone surgery ss lee jackson questionable and lb knee is probable coaches to get back on the field this week on special to put together its first complete game of the season i more i dont recall a season where we really havent played a yet this late in the season especially given the talent we are the field im also concerned about the number of penalties we ive read that mack thinks these reflect enthusiasm and i watch too many teams play with as much or more emotion and do you think we have a coaching problem or is it just ken wichita go out to stanford and win easily in other words the team took lightly thus when the cardinal played the longhorns tough won texas got tight and struggled i think this season has with little to get up for the teams on uts schedule were for the awful texas knew going into the season that it was going to be a favorite in every game except for oklahoma and texas longhorns have beaten only one team with a winning record texas point is once texas suffered the shock of losing to stanford it of its sense of urgency its dream of a national title realistic was over by the time texas played oklahoma the longhorns only a couple halves of complete football the second half and the second half against oklahoma state that enough to build the kind of confidence needed to face the sooners reason some will argue it was the rotation the werent able to instill an identity or swagger into their this is because of a lack of leadership on offense or because couldnt get up for the and of the world only and players really know but in my opinion texas has not yet put game together nine games into the season and its because of the defense has been solid with the exception of oklahoma has been slow starting erratic and even predictable to uts offense is about to set a passing yardage record yards passing per game if texas wins its next two games its bowl game the longhorns would be and that would be over last year and hard to argue with so perhaps texas can fire it showed in the first quarter against tech and put its game together this week a winning streak to end would be a great launch pad into next season when ut will again chance for greatness against a schedule of tackling likely the holiday bowl in san diego do you think mack relish a game against rick texas vs washington would great tv and a wonderful trip for the horns and their many james k of the texas game if oklahoma and nebraska both win meet in the big title game a narrow nebraska win would probably in a bowl game a narrow oklahoma win might still land them both but a lopsided win by either oklahoma or nebraska would the winner going to a bowl game and the loser going to the to oklahoma and ut beats kansas the winner of the be playing for the holiday bowl with the loser going to the the holiday bowl opponent would appear to be either oregon state the alamo bowl opponent would appear to be either michigan state i think any of those opponents would probably catch the texas except for maybe oregon state which is really reese this season carl reese is a perfect candidate for that position of his missouri ties do you see coach reese taking off for columbia michael a head coach he is getting close to and i think he would focus all of his efforts on building a national title contender in look for reese to go have not heard of him david w he has not played and will be redshirted this season he is among of players redshirting who the veterans have said look really good the other redshirts drawing raves are chance mock fb will wr tony jeffery and ol lionel been my opinion that referees calls were just part of the game youre not good enough to overcome some bad calls well youre just enough that said however we seem to have some of the worst against us in the last few years and in almost every game are held to any standard by the big or an officiating group not the officials we have got to do something about all pm about the penalties being called because hell be fined by the big can complain to the officials on the field and he can send a videotape that he thinks are questionable to the league office and lets brown has sent plenty of videotapes to the league office this is calling for instant replay in the college game he said the replay has shown how many calls are missed in a football game that schools will bite the bullet and vote in favor of this even would be a sizable expense to most schools and would slow the game cant discuss the penalties that have been called on texas this if he could his face would be red and he wouldnt be able to time or is this just the coaching staffs decision i will be one many to admit that mitchell and the offensive line have looked better over the past four games if had better mitchell with an offensive line it would seem to would also do well now that they are blocking better i to point out that i do not advocate benching mitchell by any means this weeks game and all of the talk i have heard about him or not i think that a more balanced backfield would help out in jason an offense that doesnt have many leaders and because he is such threat as a running back and receiver mitchell has within yards of a rushing season yards and yards receiving hell surpass last years yards receiving a per carry average the best on the team among except robin who has just five carries for yards yards per coaches will stick with mitchell from here on in because the showed against tech that it can gain rushing yards in the first a game now granted it was against an undersized defensive line its quickness over bulk but mack brown seems to think his team getting tougher and beginning to control the offensive line kansas has a salty defensive line led by ng nate so well see if the longhorns offensive line can continue to status for next monte about redshirting next season but that the earliest it could considered is after spring practice if not next cotton bowl and are wondering if is suddenly that far ahead of the development of their respective programs are they or was this meltdown by a young ut team can we expect better results next year so mark to pull together and show the kind of effort they have on both the ball that kind of coaching job is what its all about but i you can underestimate the influence that josh has had on he makes every part of that offense effective tremendous credit the defensive coaches for getting their players to put the brakes on texas kansas state and nebraska this has been a phenomenal and no disrespect to but next year without i think drop off slightly maybe maybe not but it seems any player at any point in the season if we need that player to help does having beau as the backup for kansas give us a of winning the game if goes down than chance mock from says mock is not even a consideration since is glen and major comes back to start or at least back up in an against texas am on tuesday mack brown announced that and not wr would be the teams the son of former ut coach david scout team position in practice and has more experience handing season than who was an option at brown said he the redshirt off of mock if he absolutely had to meaning if both went down with injuries but he said to do now would be premature because is ok and theres a chance will be back for this weekend this cant hurt home against texas tech or at oklahoma state texas would then have kansas and texas win the big south texas win the big title by beating oklahoma and if you received this newsletter from a friend and would
