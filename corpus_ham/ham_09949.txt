continues working to solidify the security of our environment several projects are underway which i wanted you to know about i also wanted to report incidents infrastructure prevented that did not cause any business interruption andor lost management initiative are working with simon burgess of net works on this desktop management initiative leverages net works for the scripted delivery of applications to our workstations and given the workstations in environment it is rather easy to quantify the value received by leveraging this service if you consider the number of applications in our environment that would require visits to each workstation or laptop for installation the s add up quickly in costs that we avoid will add additional value to service of scripted application delivery software metering and application management are the main two components delivered by this initiative upon completion support costs are expected to be reduced and the turnaround time for distributing software packages will be defender defender differs from within pd we are looking at the configuration settings of all workstations and servers once we validate a workstation or server is a supported asset we compare its configuration against published minimum supported standards and report exceptions the minimum supported standards are comprised of corporate mandated standards and required standards for the protection of our environment any exceptions are reported and are just of many projects infrastructure has underway to help improve the stability reliability and security of our environment look for more communication next month on the continuous improvements being made on connectivity to omaha and our overall business the month of october there were two incidents that confronted our environment which did not impact our business due to our fault tolerance and proactive response tools these incidents could have had a serious impact to our business so i thought it important to communicate them and how they were handled which prevented any business throughput management currently has an disk array that supports some components of the application this disk array is targeted for decommission by december the disk array presents four single points of failure for components of the application it supports once decommissioned these four single points of failure will no longer exist in the week of the disk array had power supply failures at the same time the array has three total power supplies so the single remaining power supply assumed the load while the other power supplies were in a failed state the disk array phoned via internal modem its support center which in turn notified our server support member within hours of supply failures new power supplies were installed in the disk array bringing all power supplies back online and in a desired fail over state there was no impact to business processes or end revenue management of the mirrored drives on our production rms application server failed the drive was part of a mirrored set upon failure the mirrored drive assumed the server load and our insight management application reported the failed drive to our server team within hours the failed drive was replaced the drive pair was again in a mirrored state within hours there was no impact to business processes or end are examples where our infrastructure withstood incidents i believe this communication is just as important as the communication we all desire in times of
