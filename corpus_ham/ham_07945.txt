ut on respond to inside ut football image on the big brown the dallas morning news texas writer answers about the offense mitchell the quarterbacks start time and much to chip brown talk about the longhorns colleges williams will be on hand saturday to remind longhorns fans what when ut could run the ball williams no jersey will be retired to the longhorns entrance and the coin toss for saturdays am opening kickoff against oklahoma state only one other ut jersey has and it belongs to the schools only other trophy winner no ut officials wanted to do this last year but texas didnt have a home williams new orleans saints were off this week the saints have a just a refresher williams left texas with records and among his career records that still stand are his yards rushing games and yards per carry rushing yards rushing touchdowns and total touchdowns on the career williams claimed the rushing titles in and and was the leader in just wanted to let you know that a multimedia tribute to has been available for almost a year it contains video breaking about records a panoramic tour of the ut ricky williams personal scrapbooks his rings and trophies in a few other notable features unfortunately the company that produced called run ricky has gone out of business due to the fact the not allow the company to release the title during the summer but is still available at the texas coop and longhorns q sanford williams now a year later he hasnt gotten a sniff at real playing time what happened to tailback by committee it seems like we could bigger back given the lack of blocking prowess by the bob game they came away thinking that kenny needs some they still think that ivan williams is developing the to run in college in the game coaches thought running as an aside mitchell says the running game is going to cut week he says this season has been just like last season for the running game has been stuck in glue but he says this the week if it is there would be no better than to against the nations top rushing defense is giving up just game rushing this season texas is fourth nationally against the i think it will be tough sledding for the ut should be a good passing game and feel that texas can never win a national championship with as offensive coordinator any reggie best in either rushing passing or total offense this season ut nationally in pass offense yards per game the running but he has gotten the passing game to the top with a that appears to have kept both major and chris and with receivers who are barely old enough to is in constant contact with gary of the denver broncos are considered one of the most offenses in the is constantly tapping into and trying to bring in new the ut offense i dont know if anyone works harder than he does quarterbacks love him even if they dont love this rotation they i have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that is solid in fact if there is a ut coach who could leave the staff near future for a head job or head coordinator job in the its years team when they showed last year that they could not run against the big boys you better have more balance you the line is one year older and should be better no chip sorry are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the running and picking up blitzes now not to say i told you so but it a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too in the hype and the great receiving corps shame on that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought i see ut this year and hanging around at which is where they should be still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts bad teams horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more year and take off their blinders maybe being a sportswriter during at ut helped me see through the hype larry season but i wouldnt give up on them everyone saw uts against houston in which leonard davis and derrick i think have to take leadership roles on that line allowed a de to right between them and stuff the running back for a kind of play should be a deep concern for ut coaches has and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an davis has struggled to get chemistry with backup offensive coordinator greg davis says the line tends to play the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing may be too late against a good old adage goes that you have to have a offensive line any real chance at a national title or top success so far to be true texas has just two seniors leonard davis two juniors matt anderson and a i kept hearing about how most of the players were really the passing abilities of are any of the players now chris is not playing more than he jeff weaver not chosen sides says there are times when he makes a mistake love to go back in and correct it even though his rotation is up is coming in the questions for both guys are also said there are times when he knows its his last series comes in and its and hes tempted to throw a to try to make something happen and stay in the game against had a situation like that and opted to throw a route to the safer choice it was the smarter thing to do he theory was that the coaches would try to get as much playing time in the first four games to show what he can do and then the coaches settle on one after the game i think need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to policy brown said he would employ this season the question is get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy right now tended to lean on whenever its crunch to contend with the jock favored son mack brown has to appease parents who want to see phil son as uts i think being done is a i have to say it a major a major longhorn fan from calling mack brown demanding that he give chris more or that mack brown made some deal with the family that chris would get playing time none of that is to chris the only assurance he received is that he would to for the starting job so far thats whats happened now continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that to get substantial minutes remains to be hard to argue with results so far this season heres rate for yards with and interceptions he has a of has completed of passes percent for with three and three interceptions his rating is is not trying to appease as much as he is trying to see can sara he said no i asked him if chris was playing as well as said no if one or the other was given the job until the hot hand you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to but its almost impossible to players say it doesnt matter who is playing theyre both hard to argue that major shouldnt be the man all hes done is win records is still adjusting to college ball and not being for the first time in his competitive life every time he has a football field hes been phil kid and the top choice to now hes battling with a guy who has major thought that the rotation was hurting the offense but greg davis justifiably pointed out to me that ut has passed yards through three games this year than it did last year so i break everything down in the passing game comparing uts offense games this year to the first three games of while texas has yards in to in and more td passes in the combined completion percentage of both is down to in ut also has more interceptions this year in in and one of those picks was returned for a tend to think numbers would be much better if he were start and stay in of course would have better numbers too if to play most of the game but by sharing i think both of is down maybe its just a matter of getting used to well see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude davis said tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks long tactics or texas own offensive scheme in other words is too complex so that they dont know their assignments or are being outplayed rogers seen a slew of junk defenses through the first three games coach said stanford and houston did not use that they had shown in previous contention is that other teams can make their season by beating they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the longhorns ut wasnt good enough to make the cardinal pay so according to the defenses have been new now that its the fourth game of one would think there are only so many defenses the the excuses are running brown in the running game and in the blitz pickup who is texas recruiting him i dont question matt effort but he just doesnt be getting it done for texas bart cardinal who is also being pursued by florida florida but they are happy with matt they say hes young a little more time to get adjusted to the fullback position at linebacker in high school mack brown considers a the offense despite his status as a redshirt freshman hes had blocking assignments but so have all the other weight loss the offensive line still appears overweight and is jeff madden doing the rectify this problem if this texas be looking to hire a new strength coach i know madden is a of mack browns but production has to be the bottom line and it appears madden isnt getting it done i enjoy your newsletter for your james coach for this team he works their bodies and minds and can be getting this team to believe that it could beat nebraska back in players love and respect him even though he works them to the of the breakdowns so far this season can be attributed to the players are in good shape their problems are mental one of the most valued members of the staff and then hope the other top teams pick up a loss or two could go unbeaten the rest of the way and beat an undefeated and no in the big title game the longhorns could possibly get lucky up in the orange bowl but that is about as long a shot as ricky up for ut this compare to that of chris if he wouldnt have redshirted have beat out chris or possibly major as the main brett to learn and wants to step in after and move the rub is coach brown too in love with this kid is he doing an a favor by keeping this kid in the game he had a decent season especially coming out of the shadow of ricky williams but i have this year that suggests anything close to that this seems to run to traffic there were several plays last week where step one way or the other would have gotten him to more open he would run right into the defense does he just not have required of a good running back i cannot believe that he is better than the other running backs on the roster are the rest there has to be more to the roy to really find traction last year he was on the verge of losing his victor ike when he started to really cut loose on the way to and yards receiving he says he is ready to cut loose again fourth game just like last year the problem is texas is state this week who has the nations no defense against the year mitchell broke a couple draws on oklahoma state and ran for well see if he can shake the slump hes in otherwise look for kenny to start getting more of the ut football network are listed on the web site i suggestion for people such as me who live in other parts of or overseas i have found that all i think top well one of the beauties about this site is that if you dont like of announcers you can usually switch over to those who carry the as my grandson would say and thats really cool i enjoy your very much keep it up bud sloan reno with zeal to illustrate my point coach brown became terse fans as being negative and openly critical ie in five games net yards rushing in five games a probable and lest we not forget yet another blocked punt brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight coach brown teams emotional psyche as being fragile yet coach brown euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the it not the coachs responsibility to provide stability to the and emotional state is coach browns tenure paralleling the volatile path taken by rival coach jackie at texas egos one during the david players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped brown is to criticism if someone criticizes the running game he that the passing game is rated no nationally when someone quarterback rotation he tells people to be positive instead of contends that the players are fine with it only the media is not think that brown tries to see everything in such a positive he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking that people are deeply deeply passionate about their team get mad really mad when their team loses a game it shouldnt when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldnt think brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in and with the media and has done so much to restore the ut that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of he wants fans to rally behind their team no matter what and be to pick up the team when its down not pile people are going to get angry when his team gives up five sacks gets and gives up another blocked punt for a td there is no question still adjusting to the intense scrutiny that comes with being at his team loses a game it shouldnt and plays terribly in doing so always hear it from the fans and the press whether his team is young year it seems to me doing so would open up the running game like it ricky williams was will to adjust but i do think that with the athleticism of the you will see more short routes that turn into long gains once sloan thomas and johnson develop some comfort in this think see more long pass first deals with punt returns i can respect coach mack brown wanting an experienced player returning punts in order to avoid mistakes bring in so much talent and speed if you arent going to use it why mitchell continue to return is too much of a runner to be successful in game i realize he averaged close to a return saturday average was more a product of poor field position we need returning kicks if you trust the freshmen to play why not trust them with the return why do we pull casey on passing is a load and usually gets why would you pull in a situation like that in their nickel defense push rogers outside and leave in the jeff of people thats not the greatest criteria in my opinion like to see nathan back there personally just to see what do has been fearless in everything ive seen him do shown breakaway moves yet if we dont see it soon it might be give someone else a take out on nickel situations because they think that is the better pass rusher from the tackle position there has been about moving rogers to end in situations of oklahoma in the last minutes of the houston game with a lead and two minutes to go the horns unloaded a from the arm of chris who hadnt been able to do anything just when everyone was ready to run the clock out brown or was in charge elected to do whatever necessary to humiliate even more by rubbing their noses in it i for one was not very being a for the last two minutes of that game texas took a hard blow in that move jim ball class of big sandy and live snaps because there could come a time in the future needs to move the ball late in a game to win as it needed to pass into the end zone to sloan thomas in the waning seconds was that chris made mack brown said he wished that that but actually made the right read said he bobbled or it would have been a was a huge outpouring of criticism for having pass the ball needs experience running the ball what better time to work on running than at the end of the game there is an argument to be made there said his team got criticized for not being able to hold onto the run out the clock after taking a lead at the end of the stanford he says hes being criticized for moving the ball at the end of get hammered either way brown said he added that he wasnt it up on houston for the chop block that led to rogers injury wasnt trying to pay back the cougars for what john used to do it up he said the team was just
