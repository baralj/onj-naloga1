gotta say before i get started that monday night in the scoring box was one of the more annoying moves season so of that lets jump right into our upgraded and downgraded we head down the home stretch identifying those players moving up can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from as we head into our week of listing these players that some players will have made both the upgrade or make sure you understand what talking about is players moving in other words a player like te chad lewis could appear on list and still be good enough to be a starter in your league means concerned about the way he seems to be heading likewise like wr willie jackson may make the upgrade list even though fairly far down the list of all about which are moving keeping an eye on these trends can very often make and downgrades some of these players are obvious moves up and some arent as clear heres my list of guys i see moving moving stewart pit time to give props where props are due like a new man actually he looks like the old the over the last three weeks he ranks as the in td system based on ff points per game gotta hand it to as it took some guts to bench the starting like that but has delivered probably not the best thing for jerome but rushing over the last weeks are aaron brooks no brooks made my upgrade list last week and i put where my mouth was outbidding the other owners in my league to up last week as a free agent i said last week that see with the pressure on all week obviously this is one cool kid if the footage of him in the tunnel before the game he looked like he to go out and play a game of flag football or something he made mistakes and fought back from adversity several times the is a young randall skinny and has a little those crazy legs plus got a big arm with that whippy but the biggest thing that impresses me about brooks is his him if available in your asked my friend tony pauline from the draft preview about had him ranked higher than king before the draft what brooks virginia year senior who completed of his passes throwing for touchdowns and nine interceptions and carrying the ball times for averaging yards per carry with five more scores led the acc efficiency two seasons ago throwing for who has shown great improvement in his quarterback skills the and a half smooth and fluid sets his feet in the pocket strength and stands his ground when being rushed has a live arm a needle throws ropes and his deep passes have speed on the run squares his shoulders and quickly releases the or side steps oncoming rushers pulls the ball down running tackles while he has improved his accuracy and places his passes often overthrows receivers the further down the field or out to he must get the ball the more his accuracy struggles must do job reading and recognizing defenses stop staring down his and not hold the ball so long while in the pocket a player himself into a good prospect with a solid senior campaign mid sixth tony be sure to check out great info kurt warner chomping at the bit and has been this week relieving trent green keep an eye out on how he looks coach mike said last week he was concerned about strength and ability to put rotation on the ball thinking good to donovan phi what else can you say about this guy take running game no problem give him that would struggle to division i team no problem he finds a way to get it done he looks like beginning to reach the level of dominance he enjoyed where he was unstoppable especially impressive as what going and still stop him it should be noted was injured early and he was the designated it was an impressive performance against a very good i see little reason why he continue although he really at trent bal i said a couple of weeks ago that might late season tony banks role as coach brian revives career seems very comfortable with what asking him to do and brings a little fire and attitude to the had been missing i like what doing and see why it although forget off this brad johnson was jeff george yields to the young man from his knee is reportedly good to go and been cleared by as fit to start considering the troubles the team endured at the helm johnson has already been named the starter with a nicked wr corps so see how he leaf sd stewart trent and leaf you kidding me but after another solid outing you deny leaf plays granted he still throws the ugly interceptions and he almost as much as rob johnson but the kid could make a difference if you need a spot got one of the top in the game jones and curtis and jeff graham are veterans who can make this win will have to buoy the spirits and moving mike anderson den once is a coincidence twice is a trend start handing credit to mike offensive coordinator gary that offensive line like everyone else i marveled at the way was able to run last year when davis went down what a of scouting we all thought but hey gary was a pretty highly but mike anderson a fine back but got a team deal here the good news is that team without him and he looks to remain a factor while from the mystery lower leg ailment watch this during the week surprise me a bit to see davis miss another game and as anderson rolls up rushing yards a game like he did sunday you crying over td being out granted of those yards came big run but he had a great game any way you slice lewis bal been eating crow raven for a while now as one of those guys not convinced lewis would excel at this a very disappointing season at tennessee lewis is running did as a freshman and sophomore before the knee injury and he may best blend of speed and power in the league this side of eddie brian has the raven offense firing on all cylinders and a huge part of it his only down side is that off this a bye but that week against arizona is looking corey considering what he does with that surrounding could make a strong case that corey is the best back in the have been few passing attacks in recent memory as impotent as yet continues to pound out the yards when defenses coming at them amazing to watch i know he can keep it up but got the woeful cardinals this week and to like tb made the upgrade list last week in the wake knee injury and he delivered in a big way for his with total yards including there was some talk about carries but he was the only guy besides king to run for tampa bay look for more of the same from the and coordinator warren seriously showed he could handle rushing attempts and i think continue to see them go with michael may be the lone bright spot on team i told you last week that coach loves the guy saw the results last night as rambled for yards on only like corey the surrounding team kills his if he ran for a team that held a lead be awesome unfortunately see arizona turning into such a team anytime soon so but overall i like the guy a anderson each year there are always unheralded guys nice numbers but remain well below the radar of many owners many are who quietly post yardage and ff points receiving the is a prime example of one such player this year and stanley caught passes over the last and with curtis martin nursing a sore gluteus maximus that trend will robert it take a rocket scientist to see red flags went up across the country when elected to give that shot at the sunday that would have been carry all day long looks if workload continues to be decreased brad hoover car aside from having one of those cool names the yell whenever he does something good hoover has shown to be a for he have tools of a but you deny he it surprise me a bit to see hoover continue to moving marvin harrison ind harrison stated before game that to on a looked like he started towards that end td catches and he could have had another yes like to see catches but take any week biggest worry peyton manning can stay calm enough not to strangle jerome easy balls harrison is fine and actually looking better in ward pit does anyone else find it interesting to see throwing the ball to another type player in have the name of a but certainly if be for finding a baseball cap that i amani back in a big way he had us worried a stretch earlier but playing very well right now especially out kerry collins has settled into a nice rhythm jim is sticking his neck out guaranteeing a playoff and collins to be a big part of making that sean ind with his size he better showing over the last few games that maybe over the last games he rates as the wr in fantasy points it seem to make a great deal of difference to him whether jon or brock throwing the ball he just peter time or not he scored another td this a great gamble if you need to roll the dice for a home run as liable to go for as he is score a td but sometimes those kinds of gambles that pay big the team reportedly was forcing him an eye doctor for contact lenses this could be like charlie sheen in league with the new glasses seriously if had bad vision limiting him look out once he gets the joe with ike out got all he a chance and making the most of it clearly the but when this offense is clicking the guy has keep an eye on return but he could be a nice sub if in a willie jackson no jackson is looking less with each put together a nice day sunday with catches for yards the clear cut receiver but certainly valuable aaron brooks has surprised everyone and jackson should continue to r jay be honest i really like much dismiss the fact mark seemed to almost be forcing him on the long throws draw the weaker coverage and jimmy smith and are in the lineup so he could mismatches moving freddie jones sd jones is still under the radar of a few owners as for the chargers truth is one of the better receivers in and definitely the best receiver in san diego a nice big soft hands for new leaf had receptions over jay returning to the player we knew be with receptions for yards sunday a vital part of with peerless price and jeremy not doing much much eric moulds and david dal with jackie harris nursing a sprained knee the opportunity and put together an excellent game with catches yards and a td keep an eye on harris but this could be a anthony earns the upgrade just for the td catch sunday at this point in the season rookies any more as most have enough experience that learning appears to be a fast learner and could give this team a with solid te moving jeff george was audition time is over didnt you have the danny would have loved for his pet george to go wild johnson sits down to the negotiating table to talk about next year ever do that instead he looked very average and even a little brad johnson will get the start this week you never know with so george certainly still has value just nothing like he did as a trent green chris made a great point last night on time trent green is a nice player but forget this talk being the same player as kurt warner another loss for the much guaranteed see warner this week the rams are suddenly for their lives and it be green behind shane chi the university of florida has a great program places a large number of players at the next level but be another shot putting that simply deliver the ball at a testament to coach steve spurrier that he can devise make guys like and danny look great in college clearly lack the talent put it this way has bears fan cade will get back drew ne whether the thumb or the or the is struggling i used to blame this on bill up with a jets defense that shattered confidence and into a tailspin this time of year but now have to start looking theories as terry glenn said it felt like the defense what we were going to bad for a thursday moving smith dal as you probably saw was knocked out for during the thanksgiving day game check his status this week he faces a tough stretch of games to finish the season against washington new york giants and johnson mia johnson had a nice game sunday but early that smith will be ready to play this week and that means a anderson it looks to me like the falcons are very close it in he may be worth one more start against the porous this week but after that got a bye and then new marshall understand still a top but i think his is clearly falling a bit he looks less than but the indicator by far was the robert carry weeks no way does get that carry still a must start will likely help his stock but a little curtis martin the weather conditions made it tough to get a of health but it was pretty easy to see he between bernie and anderson coach al of options and he hesitate to go with sd the big guy yields to fletcher and have lost his starting job not a huge loss as i doubt you were him for too much moving ten drop this guy if you already he with a myriad of injuries and when he does see the field he drop key robinson chi one has to wonder what could have been with healthy shane managed to get the ball to his best wr one time sunday that will not sylvester morris kc morris has been especially disappointing as expects rookies to progress during the season but he seems to be the other way over the last weeks he ranks as the wr in performance system part of that can be attributed to elvis moon but not playing well right ranks among over the last my td performance system not what looking for from a wr even if it is the these guys are just not very good i had especially high charles johnson this year but not getting it wayne as sick as i was of johnson whining not being a wr it looks he may have had a point have the speed or physical size to make a consistent impact choose to take him out of the game i love the guy and admire and determination but he struggles against double coverage and wr face double moving andrew glover no a rising tide is supposed to lift all boats told glover about that little axiom the saints continue to roll of a virtually non existent te jackie harris dal keep an eye on harris as he sprained a knee gave way to david catching a ton of ricky dudley oak maybe the most frustrating player in the soon as you bench him catch but i know how many more days i can take from this guy
