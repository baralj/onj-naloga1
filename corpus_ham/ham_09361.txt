letter mentions testing the chromatograph as well as the meters we may need to detail what exactly is testing the chromatograph they also want to test temperature and pressure sampling probes this may need to be also questioned the need to send the meters to the netherlands are there ways to nullify the effect of the flow lab could we use the facility i have called george to see if he has details regarding a document he sent out where the flow labs were trued up to match each other ken do you remember anything like that if we need to send the meters to the netherlands i have no problem with that i just wondered of it was the second page in the paragraph the starts with third i think we need to change the statement regarding matched pairs we did not flow calibrate the meters with the intent of being matched pairs we only matched the upstream piping with the flow conditioner and the meter i agree that the condition of the gas may have introduced some contaminants into the rich inlet meter and if that happened then those same contaminants may have been introduced into the rich outlet meter should we approach this with the idea that if the rich inlet test just as it did in the netherlands test then there is no reason to test the rich outlet if there is a difference in the flow test on the rich inlet then we would insist on testing the rich outlet this is just an idea it may be best to test rich inlet and rich outlet no matter what the findings attached is a small revision that needs is the proposed letter to incorporating the thoughts and comments of dari drew kathy and grant please let me have any other any of you may have of course despite the wide distribution this draft and any other communication from me should be treated as privileged and appreciate any input that you have this has to be right so please dont assume that someone else will catch a mistake that you see let me
