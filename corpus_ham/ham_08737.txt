day october markets business and other william p boswell bill burkes substituting for david j city utilities of springfield missouri david n cook general counsel michael interconnection minnesota public utilities commission and marty florida power light commissioners were all present the majority of the time left late in the afternoon staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as questions there was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who the commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible but both they and seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before could really begin to move forward there was discussion on identifying which industry group or would take in the future on an interesting tangential note there was noticeable conflict between and with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the commission staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical first major topic was how many what is their scope all panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by in strong definitive language n o one offered any specific language but seemed to be urging to issue a formal next topic was what will be standard market design panelists varied on this but most felt strong guidance from is urgent some urged for one mandatory design for north america one supported a set of rigid standard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an review process and one seemed to prefer the current commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward they continually visited this their discussions asking questions like do we need to issue a that addresses all these issues and how much detail do us to provide general feel from the seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas and burkes went so far as to say should mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go further others seemed to be a little worried about this idea but in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the design and implementation section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to design indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry the section to which wood referred was one that i wrote and asked the following congestion management when operational security violations occur how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient will based systems be standard or will others that must be accommodated transmission service are transmission services required to schedule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are loop flows are based or transmission services appropriate if based how are parallel path be addressed transmission service should contracts existing prior to development be transferred or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts are there other solutions energy imbalance markets how are imbalance markets to they serve as energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced schedules or will they be required at all ancillary services will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways will entities be required to actually schedule required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments protecting against charges losses can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technically unwieldy how are to be integrated into the new world should systems be designed with the assumption that will be part of an or should they be designed to treat each as a separate will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will take a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie with financial hedging instruments will take only months the commission asked mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues for a funny point one of the commissioners i think referred to some concerns expressed in the northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes inefficient for the northwest flat outsaid my profession is understanding how power systems work and i dont believe that that statement is true he then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the northwest interests was and great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single organization went so far as to ask are we looking at a beauty contest between and cook and boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each others organizations other participants continually reiterated the need for one independent organization interestingly boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in while cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of not focus on its offered some passive support of by pointedly asking both cook and boswell if they lobbied political positions ie not only an organization but also a stakeholder was easily able to say they were not but of course had to admit to their romancing of congress and the bush administration for reliability legislation point acted as somewhat of a supporter for playing dave cooks he probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to supposed successes such as tlr and if staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulting in several filings and interventions we may also wish to file specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to pretty picture marty painted was in fact a was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that i could not be done there was also some talk of folding under arguments began winding down after a some time and boswell strongly urged the commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether or should lead the industry forward somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position in general i it was a close fight but came out more on me know if you have any affairs
