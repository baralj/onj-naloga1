two weeks ago but it obviously to keep the starting kc ramiro updated injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the bills injury wont likely keep him from playing this week against well see wednesday or thursday said head coach but from what the doctors told me i think the for him to dt den the rounders updated ray will miss at least four games with a the injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter was chasing down chargers jeff graham spencer will take over position until he smith free agent updated looks likely to get the start when the bengals play scott mitchell who started sundays game against new england as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game smith is starting doesnt mean you should do the same he needs in gear before hell have any fantasy davis den thrill kill cult updated will undergo another this week on his injured leg and is having in san francisco crosscheck the results at this point the preparing for this weeks game against seattle as if davis if you have davis backup mike anderson it seems like a to include him in your starting lineup this martin fear updated status of the jets running back for this weeks game against the still uncertain martin left sundays game in miami with what as a strained back and never returned to the field he had by team doctors yesterday and had some taken as club hasnt released any information on the of the exam is on your fantasy squad your best bet is to stay tuned as the coles wr fear updated to new york coles will be unable to play in this against the bears he was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff second half in sundays win over the dolphins if coles is an of your roster look to pick up ward who should get more in coles joe no free agent updated saints resigned yesterday after the veteran had by the team during training camp with jeff blake out for the season needed a no quarterback so will fill that role aaron brooks and backup jake blake no fear updated saints placed blake on injured reserve yesterday officially ending he will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is will be replaced by aaron smith mia thrill kill cult updated status is still not certain but he does expect to return game against the colts he left last weeks game against the aggravating his strained right hamstring an injury which he week earlier against the chargers smith has been one of the fantasy sleepers and has become an everyday starter for owners who were lucky enough to grab him if he does in fact week be sure to include him in your starting mia thrill kill cult updated his status is still up in the air expects that he will to play in sundays showdown against the colts on the first play of the jets game when linebacker mo lewis head and shoulder into the turf he suffered a slightly shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back fielder isnt the better options in the fantasy game so avoid playing him this if he does johnson was the fat bastards updated redskins should know by thursday if johnson can reassume his for this weeks showdown against the eagles he has started to test left knee with some light and will likely push the during practice on wednesday and wr free agent updated the injury to ike will likely start this at arizona with only receptions on the entire season a solid fantasy option so dont pick him up unless your roster for dt ramiro updated has been lost for the rest of the season with labrum in his right shoulder he suffered the injury three weeks new england has tried to play through the pain but the injury in each of buffalos last two games head coach announced to the media that will have surgery his loss will hurt buffalos secondary but they remain a in the world of sea free agent updated coach mike has named the starter for this weeks the broncos took all of the snaps with the first team a bye week and is ready to make his first start since sustaining on oct in oakland isnt considered a solid so dont start him until he shows some signs that he is ready dt free agent updated arizona defense came out of sundays loss to the eagles extremely linebacker zach who just recently returned from knee surgery with a broken left leg defensive tackle mark smith hurt his had his arm in a sling on monday safety was in the game suffering a sprained knee with all of these injuries its probably a good idea to keep the cardinals defense on this tb the fat bastards updated probably will miss the rest of the regular season after left knee in tampa bays loss to the chicago bears on sunday described injury as a sprain of the ligament and said he is expected to be sidelined six to charles kirby a pro in his first season with tampa replace wr updated posted a great day for his fantasy owners against detroit passes for yards in the giants loss he may have a time next week against cornerback so start him at your own barber the rounders updated caught eight passes and compiled yards of total offense loss to the lions look for barber to get a number of looks out backfield this week against arizona as the giants attempt to the loss of wide receiver ike collins the rounders updated threw a passes on sunday but it wasnt enough the lions collins has been a more productive fantasy option of eight touchdown passes in his last three games he may run into block this week against the cardinals however especially if is unable to play without arizona can put aeneas williams on amani leaving tiki barber and as collins only real receiving options if you can find a than collins this week it might be a good idea to wr dal the lie downs updated caught four passes for yards in sundays loss at baltimore however be a good sleeper pick this week against the secondary can be beaten downfield so look for to break a few long ones in an effort to spark a banged up dallas smith dal ramiro updated had his second consecutive subpar performance on sunday against rushing for only yards on eleven carries he has been held to yards rushing in the past two weeks which is significant when that smith is one of the leagues greatest running backs the combination of a short week and the loss of center will hurt smiths production so it might be a good idea to sit week if your roster allows dal free agent updated found out just how good the ravens defense is on sunday just passes for yards and three interceptions loss in baltimore faces a minnesota defense that has been solid in recent weeks so dont expect any kind explosion from the cowboys aging wr the fat bastards updated who left sundays game against the lions with a bruised lung will remain in the hospital for the next two days and will this sundays game against arizona look for joe to start place but dont expect him to produce the same type of has anderson the snake pit updated ran times for yards against the sunday although become more confident in putting weight on his bad knee you see anderson have a big game until next season dont expect things any better for anderson next week when he goes up against a tough morton wr det the snake pit updated awakened from his slumber to catch six passes for yards giants sunday he only had one catch in each of the lions last morton will probably struggle once again this thursday when the a formidable patriots mean machine updated completing passes threw for yards with and one interception he showed extreme toughness the game despite suffering a sprained foot a week earlier be just as effective next week against a docile panthers pass wont put too much pressure on allowing him to dissect and pile up fantasy wr updated packers had what might have been his best game of the the colts sunday racking up yards on eight catches he to post numbers like this but look for to have against the panthers this green ramiro updated ran for a yards on carries sunday against his success should continue in games against the weak of the panthers bears and brooks no free agent updated relief of blake the brooks completed passes for with two touchdowns and one interception owners of jeff blake to consider picking up brooks it will take some time for brooks to to playing in the but he could put up solid numbers in the of the season as the saints face a plethora of weak pass inc and
