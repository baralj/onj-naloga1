constant pain in the wrist hadit and placed in a cast after practice yesterday and it will with him out courtney hawkins will continue to start in his the next four white free agent updated browns have listed white as questionable with a shoulder injury game against jacksonville he has performed fairly well rookie travis prentice in recent weeks and may earn in the browns plans for he wont provide you this season dt the snake pit updated jaguars will be without linebackers hardy who has a and erik who has a broken thumb as well as safety erik has an ankle injury for sundays game against the browns marts listed as probable after missing four games with injury and kevin hardy probable with an ankle injury are to play despite all the injuries keep in mind that this might best week to start the jacksonville defense as it faces a that has been decimated by wr updated green lantern had his light burned out last week against the only one pass for eight yards in the entire game after four has caught only four passes for yards over his last he faces off against a colts secondary that he burned for and yards receiving in week ten so a productive day is out of the question although he hasnt been overly consistent likely find his way onto many starting lineups as the playoffs shea te free agent updated is listed as questionable with a thigh muscle injury for sundays jacksonville if he cant play either mark campbell who served as last sunday or santiago would be the tight end even if shea isnt going to carry your fantasy team through the anderson free agent updated continued to be the jets secret weapon last week catching for yards and a score against the bears although have been commendable between the lines his value in the world isnt as solid unless you are involved in a deeper league anderson during your fantasy santiago te free agent updated is listed as questionable with a knee injury for the browns jacksonville on sunday if he cant go mark campbell would be the end and if aaron shea is also out then marc edwards would serve backup for the second straight game we dont recommend any of tight free agent updated has been surprisingly productive over the past two weeks time with curtis martin who has been less than percent his gluteus maximus caught six passes and accounted for of total offense in last weeks win over chicago starting playoffs however is extremely risky so stick with martin or look option if free agent updated coach chris palmer hasnt made a final decision on who will start sunday against jacksonville although if bruised heal in time it would make the decision an easy one was of throwing drills yesterday and will probably be limited the rest of and looks to be a decision palmer may opt to use wynn this week either way considering the browns struggles in game added to this quarterback controversy isnt going fantasy owners during the mitchell free agent updated to the cincinnati enquirer the bengals are planning mitchell over the next few games in hopes that he will resign with smith for the starting job next season team brown made the statements after watching mitchell participate in practice in days yesterday mitchell is expected to start arizona after missing last sundays game with a sprained despite a weak cardinals defense we dont recommend him for playoff sanders wr mean machine updated is listed as questionable for this weeks game against the a injury the injury certainly hasnt helped his numbers caught only five passes for yards in his last two games sanders if at all possible especially during the playoffs he too inconsistent to play at such a crucial stage of your boston wr the lie downs updated caught only one pass for yards in last weeks loss to the has been hampered by a nagging hamstring injury of late which hasnt numbers in recent weeks he has had only one game with more than receiving in the last six weeks and has scored only once in that if the cards offense is ever going to score however it against the bengals unless you have more solid receivers on your boston simply on this weeks isnt a bad hearst sf free agent updated is listed as questionable on the injury report but wont be of to a fantasy team this season he was recently activated from list after missing most and with an ankle moore no the fat bastards updated has been downgraded to questionable on the injury report he shoulder stinger in sundays game against st louis if he is unable chad morton and terry allen will handle the carries the saints able to run on every team they have played this season no matter is but if you are going to use a new orleans back go with is the healthiest and most explosive of the jones fear updated could see some increased playing time now that the season is coming toa close but he will still have little impact for fantasy owners at in the season jones rookie campaign has been a real he should have been a casuality for owners much earlier in the ramiro updated had a huge game against the giants last week catching ten compiling yards of total offense he also scored the touchdown of the game on a pass from dave brown a cincinnati defense this week that ranks in the league against so he could be in line for another strong performance the only fantasy owners who have on their roster should worry about is decides to give rookie thomas jones more playing time now that is winding k free agent updated rams are expected to decide on thursday whether or not enough to play he will undergo an extensive kicking routine be evaluated from thereafter has missed the past few of a quadriceps hayes wr car mean machine updated practiced wednesday and will likely play in sundays game against he missed mondays game against the rams due to a groin injury been a star by no means this season but he has been helpful to car the rounders updated looks like rookie brad hoover will start at again this sunday for has been sidelined for the past few weeks by he was listed as probable for sundays home game against but left practice early wednesday after experiencing pain in his say right now his status is probably a little more questionable than it would be head coach george told the charlotte observer it would be wise to keep out of your lineup although a good game this week it might even be safer to use a more proven back fantasy oak the lie downs updated practiced on wednesday and is listed as probable for this against the steelers head coach jon said that well during the workout so expect the raiders back to be ready has proven that he has a high tolerance for pain so even isnt percent for the game fantasy owners can rest he will goodman free agent updated packers have activated goodman from their practice squad he had five games this season before being placed on the practice team he is used primarily on special teams and will be of little a fantasy team at this point in the bradford wr free agent updated missing most of the season because of a broken leg bradford is from torn cartilage in his right knee he still hopes to a december game against the lions right now he is having off on his knee stay away from bradford in your fantasy next kc ramiro updated returned to practice on wednesday and will likely return for game against new england although he is still listed on the injury report head coach gunther right now id say hell play said but well today brings since isnt a definite starter this week be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it especially with the fantasy playoffs smith mia thrill kill cult updated injured right hamstring has made significant progress since last weeks game against the colts and the dolphins are that he could return for this weeks game against experiencing a slight tweak in the hamstring after smith still believes he will be ready to go i feel fine i have no pain in my leg im running and cutting without any fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation however would to steer clear of smith this week playing in the cold at buffalo smiths performance which is a chance you wont want to take at of the mia thrill kill cult updated to earlier reports the dolphins are now optimistic that be their starting quarterback for this weeks game against buffalo percent of the snaps with the first team during wednesdays reported that he felt fine it would be a remarkable recovery who couldnt even raise his right arm on sunday if hes hes starting said head coach dave even if he fielder isnt a very strong option for fantasy owners who to their leagues chi free agent updated has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season where have we before during the bulked up to pounds and run over the opposition he looked slow carrying the ball this season replaced at hb by james allen with hb and allen in may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere he is down to already and would like to reach even if he does reach this count on him being too productive wait and see if he reemerges as before you gamble and put him on your fantasy team next chi free agent updated is listed as questionable but will be the emergency for against the bears behind shane and backup mark that is done for the fantasy season his him helpless for the latter part of but even when he he didnt produce too player garner active updated emerged from a slump by gaining yards on carries a touchdown look for garner to have a big game next week against atlanta falcons freeman active wr updated had a relatively quiet game sunday against the colts catching passes for yards he did manage to haul in a td pass no receiver bill wont have the game that he week which will allow the mediocre panthers secondary to focus freeman his numbers will improve this week but only hicks reserve updated saw limited action in sundays game against the ravens he rushed for seven yards and caught one pass for five yards unless goes down hicks wont see much active wr updated accounted for yards of total offense and a touchdown in last win over arizona he will face off against a talented this week that held him to only three catches and yards in first meeting if your other have more favorable week it might be wise to bench watson reserve updated fared better in his second start for marshall sunday he yards on reserve updated the injury to sammy morris it looks as though will get the week against the chiefs if morris has been one of your main season it may be a good idea to pick up if he is holt active wr updated holt caught six passes for yards against the saints sunday look to put up similar numbers against the panthers reserve updated was against washington accounting for yards of and two touchdowns in the eagles win at field he offensive unit on his shoulders and singlehandedly kept philadelphia place in the east up next will face a tough who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the jaguars dont numbers from this week but do expect him to be the focal offense once active te updated finally found the end zone scoring a touchdown in what was a for him against dallas sunday just one week after an performance against washington broke loose for catches yards keep in mind that hes been getting opportunities lately due injury to jimmy smith so his numbers shouldnt remain so mark will likely look to his tight end more often in the anderson active k updated continued his accuracy this season by making both of his attempts day he has made attempts this season and is a year similar to the one he had in when he was perfect in season however he is old and doesnt kick the long ones like to anderson wont go beyond yards anymore but is pinpoint from look for him to add a few more field goals against the lions davis active updated coach turner has indicated that davis should be ready to play weeks pivotal east against the giants davis missed game against the eagles with a hairline fracture of his right return of davis is great news for fantasy players who own his with the playoffs just around the active updated coach steve is considering giving backups rick tim some playing time at the end of games to evaluate with the team this wont hurt production too much cost him a few cheap at the end of games weve talked about told the contra costa times i wouldnt mind rick playing bit either if a situation presented itself when you could third guy in there without hurting the football team i would consider reserve wr updated packers had what might have been his best game of the the colts sunday racking up yards on eight catches he to post numbers like this but look for to have against the panthers this reserve updated nine carries gained just yards if you start him at the fantasy playoffs you may be risking your robinson reserve wr updated having cade throw to him has really hurt playing with in his first six games this season robinson had for yards average and four touchdowns in his last robinson has just catches for yards yards with except for one quarter against the eagles jim miller and were the quarterbacks in those ballgames is still or so away from playing so look for robinson to continue to reserve dt updated cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive sunday first team to achieve the feat this season the ravens defense another dominating performance foiled in its quest to post fifth shutout of the season baltimore held the browns to points and a staggering net yards the ravens also had six interception and two fumble recoveries in the game its probably safe that owners of this defense are already although its bye week next fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this their playoff run as the team faces weaker offenses san diego coming off the active dt updated skins expect to have both cornerback darrell green and shawn barber back for monday night tilt with green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle while missed two games with a sprained in his right knee washington a big performance from their defense on monday night if they are to chance at beating the champs in the inc and
