email cyrus email and in one place with all of this talk of impending war many of us will encounter peace activists who will try and convince us that we must refrain from retaliating against the ones who terrorized us all on september these activists may be alone or in a of us dont know how to react to them when you come upon one of these people or one of their rallies here are the proper rules of listen politely while this person explains their views strike up a conversation if necessary and look very interested in their ideas they will tell you how revenge is immoral and that by attacking the people who did this to us we will only bring on more violence they will probably use many arguments ranging from political to religious to humanitarian in the middle of their remarks without any gt warning punch them in the nose when the person gets up off of the ground they will be very angry and they may try to hit you so be careful very quickly and calmly remind the person that violence only brings about more violence and remind them of their stand on this matter tell them if they are really committed to a nonviolent approach to undeserved attacks they will turn the other cheek and negotiate a solution tell them they must lead by example if they really believe what they are saying most of them will think for a moment and then agree that you are correct as soon as they do that hit them again only this time hit them much harder square in the nose repeat steps until the desired results are obtained and the idiot realizes how stupid of an argument is making there is no difference in an individual attacking an unsuspecting victim or a group of terrorists attacking a nation of people it is unacceptable and must be dealt with perhaps at a high cost we owe our military a huge debt for what they are about to do for us and our children we must support them and our leaders at times like these we have no choice we either strike back very hard or we will keep getting hit in the you yahoo
