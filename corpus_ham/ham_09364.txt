concern i raised continued to be somewhat of an issue last when we were only flowing gas to the rich side for processing ops needs to determine if it could be an issue and whether it should be mentioned and what we expect if it does become an issue mary phil mary kay dave don shelley and asked me to send this latest version of proposed special test response letter to each of you for your review and authority to send out i have received comments from mary kay don drew and rick and hope i adequately captured them if i have missed something critical of course please let me know kay will note that i said nothing about a potential problem that she has mentioned in her comments that is because i thought i was told that all the gas that we are now flowing and would reasonably expect to flow to could be routed through the rich stream and measured by one pair of meters if i understand mary kays point the problem arises only if you have so much unprocessed gas coming in you have to bypass the plant and take the unprocessed gas straight to the customers which might cause downstream etc mary kay if the problem is a different problem let me know also it is absolutely critical that we feel confident that we can send all the unprocessed gas through the rich stream for the indefinite future can the right person tell us with authority that this is the are proposing as our choice of testing facility i know that we very concerned about the effect in any future litigation about testing at given steve role in the past arbitration and are considering using the testing facility bill frasier has recently mentioned that the test facility may have a substantial problem with swirl in the gas flow upstream of the test meters further if we use any test facility but we face the risk of having the inherent bias of that test facility being thrown at us as evidence of meter inaccuracy with regard to past will reply that is by far the lowest cost alternative among and given that our equipment is apparently within trucking distance of the lab bill frasier has kindly agreed to review the various will hopes to have an estimate to us comparing the cost of flow testing at vs vs by tomorrow afternoon i assume that will probably be the least expensive and least good solution to the testing facility issue was suggested by dave with grants additional refinement which is to have an agreement that if we use then neither nor any of the employees could be called as fact or expert witnesses in any subsequent litigation further grant suggested that we also require that the inherent bias in a certain percentage be factored out of any calculation of part of his analysis frasier will also be looking at testing scenarios vs testing scenarios the testing scenario is item in the current draft the testing scenario was item in the last draft which i have deleted in this draft the reason for deleting it is primarily cost i have not been able to think of any argument under which we could reasonably require to be liable for all the costs of special testing the lean meters drew and i discussed that the flow testing of the rich meters may answer a lot of problems the swapping out of the original lean meters onto the rich line in the process may also give us some valuable risk of the scenario is that we think the lean stream meters may actually be measuring slightly in favor if we put the lean stream meters on the rich stream and the variance between plant loss as measured by our meters and the plant meters in fact significantly decreases may use this as evidence that the lean stream meters are measuring more accurately than the rich stream meters we may then be in a position of being forced to ask for a special test of the remaining pair of meters at this point i am thinking that we will deal with that problem if it in fact for the lengthy email i await your
