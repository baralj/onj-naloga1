you all know the flag football game was called off the structure is to give tickets to and to ac the team the most by pm monday for each company will be awarded and the game will be rescheduled for sometime in the beginning very disappointed with the way this whole situation has been cant speak as to what occurred on the anderson side but these are on this all the captains including the aggies agreed to play of the weather i confirmed that we would be on as rain and were very likely to occur had the other captains decided to in the cold rain we could have rescheduled the game for sunday or my understanding is that the aggies called the game billy bland and then changed the awarding of the tickets in way that the aggie teams correct me if im wrong but neither billy were out at the field to judge the weather conditions prior to the game nor were the captains contacted for their input the been changed in midstream to the advantage of the aggies is grossly unfair the top fund raisers for the aggie to be awarded footballs that were by the aggie given this additional incentive its not surprising that more money than the ut teams by my unofficial estimates by who was familiar with the aggie fund efforts one about and the other raised about what do we do about this situation its up to you to decide if you play in the rescheduled tournament personally i dont see much motivation to play it surely wont be for bragging rights as the game will have already occurred in addition i think it would to give the people who donated funds the option to get back the situation that now exists is not what i raised money want to thank you all for the work and effort you put forth for this unfortunate that it wasnt handled will be out all of next week leave me a if you need to me i will have your shirts on the monday following thanksgiving
