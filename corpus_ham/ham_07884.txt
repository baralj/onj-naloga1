ut on respond to inside ut football image for brown who covers texas football for the dallas morning your questions about rebounding from the oklahoma loss as the sole starter promotions for roy williams and more inside texas football appears each to chip brown talk about the longhorns colleges week texas faces the man whom ut officials considered a finalist longhorns coaching job awarded to mack brown the longhorns travel and meet gary team has ever beaten texas seven straight times but thats exactly buffaloes will be trying to do this week colorado has won six ut dating to texas last beat colorado in the and hasnt won in boulder since of the last three games have been decided on the final won on a field goal in austin in and the mary pass fell incomplete in a loss in boulder in the play of his team in its first victory of the season over texas play of our offensive line was the most dominant weve had i felt line and all the kids really cut it loose for the first time this were a much more focused years they are loaded with talent on both sides of the ball and depth youve got to think after their loss to oklahoma they in here really inspired it should be a good the for us is to hold up defensively against their passing hes forced the hand of a lot of players and gotten they have been able to handpick the players they want out of you can get roy williams johnson and sloan thomas in the something is going on something good we recruited all of the hype around had something to do with it too to play with a good q to the starting marge by coach mack brown brown said chris would only be used on basis meaning that for the first time this season there is to play both this week the coaches are hoping that by turning over to exclusively there will be a spark ut greg davis said however that texas could go back to the after this week the coaches will wait and see as far as johnson will start at flanker ahead of brandon and will start at split end ahead of flowers the coaches promotions in part to help encourage williams and johnson to of a vocal leadership role and coaches said freshman tight end might see more playing time and running back kenny will carries than the two he had against last back during first and second down to increase their chances at situation i believe mitchell is more of a who is better suited for throwing to out of the backfield than he is who can pound the ball straight ahead and pick up four to six yards and second down watching the game last week and previous games ive noticed too many times that texas has put itself in third situations due to up anything on the first two downs kenny in my physical back who doesnt go down as easy they should put him in first and second down to pick up some positive yardage and bring to run draw plays and block on third down since he has good hands a reliable blocker eric barker a moot point mack brown said he should have run the ball more in half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer but he said foolish enough to think his team could come back so ut tried to score quickly took most of the snaps in practice so look for him to get more of a chance against lance recruits to game so ut will be allowed to bring recruits to on josh why do we run so many patterns on us the answers chip what are the coaches comments on these anderson became somewhat irrelevant in the game pretty quickly because ut to pass to try to get back in it but mitchell did get a lot mostly because he ran for yards in last years game and is the bigger receiving threat look for to get more carries its hard to believe that rogers makes that big of a casey said ut would have gotten more pressure on if in there rogers is expected to play this week the to offensive coordinator greg davis are the routes that is giving texas the coaches want the receivers to become more backs after the catch and use their speed and moves to break for was more shocked than me when the alumni and turned on so viciously after the loss to in not only was i the time but i was even more horrified to learn that this was par course for ut football coaches mack brown seems to have been by the community over the last two years but im worried we to see a repeat of history what do you lisa davis people were talking about hiring john as or bringing in spike dykes to talk to ut about how to being blown out all of this is crazy now i will grant you that with colorado is as far as the big title if ut loses horns will pretty much need the rest of the big south to fall apart to get into the league title game but if ut wins the horns are the drivers seat for the big south title i say that because of winning two of three against no nebraska no kansas at texas slim the chances are good the sooners will emerge with two losses in those games texas can get right back in the race with saturday if the longhorns do win and ut looks good with major then everyone will say i told you so mack regarding the slowed down uts offense all season but the critical fans will mack and move on if texas loses i think people will be upset will also need to get behind mack brown and start building support rest of this season and next season mack brown isnt going be around texas for a good i would do in their situation having said that i now must say that a while one begins to wonder about the coaching youve said that the coaches shouldnt be blamed for the longhorns most of the time i agree with you however this pattern ut seems amazes me every few games everything just blows up and we how can a team with such obviously great talent manage to horribly in my only thought is that it has to be the coaching its not arent good enough kenny proves in the game to be to the running games problem why replace him the next weekend much bigger game with the truly hardworking but honestly mitchell why run the ball over and over when it obviously or it could work if the right players were in these things do you think the coaching is one of the problems what can be done the inconsistencies that are actually becoming consistent and pattern of embarrassing losses last year there was state and last three awful games this year its mediocre stanford and the not that good will it ever stop thanks i enjoy your david going and kept punching texas in the face and ut never got a punch in the sooners down josh looked like joe montana and the on the biggest problem for texas right now is no leadership on the offensive reins to major this week is a great move it could give the longhorns confidence if its not too late and psyche hasnt been beaten down too much the offensive line has emotional leaders is developing into that guy of the other guys are fiery vocal guys and has been leader to this point because he has been so worried about is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader that stuff in players either you have it or you dont on defense and rogers are the heart and soul on special teams beau to take command on offense its clearly who will have up maybe the end of the rotation will help him do team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new or two each week the opposing team always seems to know what while texas is always caught by surprise early on on offense is extremely predictable and increasingly uncreative the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against texas defense never seems to have made an adjustment the defense uses the without mixing things up enough both coach reese and coach extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a setback well we have suffered both so why not give the players and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on after seeing something totally new it seemed to work against a little different blocking scheme good job but do it every against the tougher opponents do you see these problems todd calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it texas well in the shotgun offense but davis said that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced the run and the pass at some point and maybe this week if that open any holes for the backs it will be time to give up hopes of and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up well see if things improve this week there is no question that are rethinking everything right now davis also said he has the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early one thing that is very disturbing to me now above winning the other team just wanted it more after oklahoma it was who said it i remember reading the same comments after arkansas why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents it the players will not give it up for mack brown as the sooners might bob stoops the hogs do for their coach etc mike texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of new attitude brought in by mack brown the longhorns got up for nebraska and and texas and won but now that the favorite in every game the longhorns are struggling even built north carolina into a national power by the end of his the tar heels were never expected to win a national title but brown has done to stir up interest and belief in texas players beating nebraska twice reestablishing tradition he will to contend for a national title here in the very near future so to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as even when have every reason to beat the longhorns the past five losses come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat ut than to beat them texas and the bonfire tragedy nebraska beaten by ut three straight times arkansas finally back in the looking to beat its old rival stanford coming off loss to and oklahoma loser of three straight to ut if texas has any fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and team more hungry again some of that will have to come from players some of it will be mack brown reinventing himself arousing the senses of his players in different outplayed in all phases of the game even more disappointing fact that we were thoroughly too i am convinced that schemes will continue to be inconsistent at best against defenses in the country to support my argument i reviewed the games including this one we have played against good nebraska twice am arkansas the results are have averaged passing yards per game would in the country in and rushing yards per game in in our total offense of yards per game would rank country in although this review could be construed as it still makes my point that our offense is well below facing better defenses i feel like greg davis is getting too for our offensive output against bad defenses resulting in a see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme i would like your comments prevailing problem and i would also like to know where kenny saturday perhaps by having one running the offense things will settle some more offensive flow will result i think the answers may perhaps if can get things moving without fear of the confidence will spread everywhere including the booth are being called without question when a team is struggling is to simplify well ut cant afford to simplify its offense that was used in the first game the team seemed to come when they began using that offense along with the appearance of major i believe if this offense would have been used against stanford team would have been unbeaten going into the offense not make another appearance until a dire situation in the game the horns used it they moved the ball down the field and scored use this more and keep the defense guessing unlike most coaches with this style of offense the pass will set up the run and we love to see a consistent running brian offense creates a tempo it forces the game to go a situation where everything is done at the line the argument it as a standard offense is that it goes against our overall being balanced with the run and the features whatsoever which sets the program back at least a not more so tell us something good chip please rogers for the big south in my opinion i would be surprised if bounce back with its best effort of the season if there is a and texas loses it will be time to take the bad with the good storybook season there is a season where everything doesnt place as expected but lets see what happens this week the effects game wont set the program back a year unless the longhorns let it bounces back this week and wins the longhorns have a pretty good get to the with only one league loss lets see what michael vick michael vick redshirted at virginia tech and from it it was even his idea they made a pretty big deal about brad benefit from a redshirt year and chris probably would i should have stated that vick is the perfect example thank you the record than chris does do you think this is legit or is it since has been starting and the receivers are cold comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to all cylinders also why is the coaching staff giving every win the starting position when it is obvious to fans coaches that is the leader and the one to watch out for lives up to his pedigree as everyone hopes he wouldnt have hurt if he lost the starting job to someone superior to brandon could live with it as long as it was best for the team he said he pressing and that interceptions have become a regular negative in he said the grade he would give himself this season would be he says in his heart he believes he will show everyone the promise been expected of him since leaving high school as the nations top mckay on the football patel he hasnt been able to capture sizable playing time as yet lost his punt return duties to mitchell and has even fallen as a backup in that role so needs to try to coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make of it otherwise there may not be enough snaps at split end behind roy williams and flowers miguel mckay is on and got playing time at defensive tackle against i dont think its unreasonable to expect more out of the texas has ut has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last as any program in the country using the logic that has been offered some ut followers we should be patient and wait until next year or at that point we will be waiting for the inexperienced to mature or some other aspect of the team i dont know actual difference between the dominant programs and ut is but i that it has something to do with getting senior performance whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation know what do you kevin p ut has and once texas shows that it can crack the top before the end of october and if mack brown can keep getting school recruits the longhorns will be expected to be in the top on so starting next year i think its fair to put texas in the top expect them to stay there all season the ut towers freshmen will have a year of experience leonard davis will be gone from but should be a suitable replacement and ut will its running backs back except for mitchell the defense will draft picks casey and rogers but and lee should be suitable replacements the senior other areas will have to make up for the loss of this years key because he is a receiver as a supporter of the i got to witness johnson in a situation in last game he was an awesome player last year until that will he be as big of a threat as roy williams duke garland leadership will be needed on this offense beginning saturday as says freshmen are only freshmen until midseason then they have to play like upperclassmen but williams and johnson will both in my major has never done anything but show he is one of confident proven leaders from the position in the nation in not even his injury or the fact that chris got a lot of the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time you what you want and brown would obviously talk around this but we have lost the stanford game if had started and played game both and the offense as a whole have not played up to theyre capable of playing because of the inconsistency at a creates doubt and a lack of confidence for everyone involved media and fans have fallen in love with an unproven commodity while shucking aside an individual who did everything possible to should be the starter mack browns job is to be above that and its him to take the heat the media and fans are touching on this but its time to tell it like it is with his illogical failed and jason for this it will televise that weekend right now
