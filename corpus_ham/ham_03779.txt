game heres how i see the this week exactly where i rank players and to determine who to start just one may be more favorable than another that mean id start the player with the best the is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to davis was vs cowboy defense new coach terry run davis into the ground against a run defense as soft no telling how many yards gain the arm seems ok and for a huge game here roll up yards on dallas like chris warren phi vs brown defense it remains to be effect if any newly signed chris warren will have this week surprise me a bit if andy reid able to come up with at small package of plays that feature warren a thousand times if he go this week look for him to be next week for sure the browns defense ranks in rushing per game over the last four weeks so the is taylor vs cardinal defense every once in a while those to be pan out this is certainly one of good to be situations but be shocked if taylor over the cards they stop the run even when they know at them arizona ranks in rushing yards allowed per game last month that number go down any after this anderson den vs defense starting any player facing the is not a bad rule of thumb been pretty bad and this stand a chance against the dominating ol of denver fully thursday so he looks good to go keep an eye on the expecting snow in denver but not too worried about how vs steeler defense this was the type of game they for a ground war vs in december not likely will jump to a big lead and force the giants to catchup mode pretty much no this is shaping up to be a classic battle on one side and warren on the morris shawn vs colts defense keep an eye on who for the bills this week but whoever starts will likely have some numbers on the carpet in indiana there were some semi that morris might be back the colts rank just over the last in rushing yards allowed per game soft on the run could make a big splash on monday garner sf vs saints defense just as they are with their pass the saints rush defense is overrated over the last four rank in rushing yards allowed per game and garner is liable at any time too good in both the rushing and passing game sitting down unless just tb vs miami defense it was surprising to me to see the slide this far on rush defense over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game seem right but the numbers say either way a must start given what smith min vs ram defense like the passing defense the rams has improved over the year it matter though start robert smith end of story he may be the best in the truth be smith dal vs redskin defense i think i may be the only one who it this way but i believe the chris warren booting was a for smith sure he still may not get the down carries get a look at michael but is pretty much working here he proved his mettle once again last week hammering against tampa team the cowboys also showed how little faith they have passing game as they continued to feed smith the ball even badly washington ranks over the last four weeks in allowed per game so very richardson kc vs panther defense another week another kc as this time anders out of the mix i honestly a hard time trusting coach gunther with any of them but like richardson will get the bulk of the work right now the be run on keep an eye on the weather in this one as the passing be allen chi vs patriot defense what a mess chicago finds itself the messiah is now healthy but still on the bench while the coordinator has left been run out of town for utah and are gone for the year with injuries james allen may be the spot as run hard and effectively the new england defense vulnerable to the run and this may be another week where they rely to carry a heavy james ind vs bills defense may be having one of seasons in history posting great numbers overall but have a hard time finding a james owner real happy with him your guy you have very little choice but to start him in the game the colts are tougher at home and hopefully they playing catchup again although with his receiving ability active in that situation but not the ideal scenario for any his team is playing from behind the bills rank over the weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so a pretty oak vs jets defense keep an eye on this one for but hearing while the ankles may be better a broken finger may be him trouble some are speculating this is the cause of his week the jets play pretty solid rush defense so truly a could go either way try to see what i can find out on this vs jaguar defense the injury as still battling turf toe he sat out of practice may not know his status until friday or saturday if he go like clarence williams could get the start if likely available in your league even assuming can not a great as the jags have picked up the level of their smith mia vs buccaneer defense let the defense a very good unit but as smith proved last week rusher can fare ok there smith surely falls under that class if your guy still go with over the last four week in rushing yards allowed per game an average of yards per game over that time so not baltimore yards per game over their last martin vs raider defense like tampa the raiders rush a bark a little worse than their bite solid that sends running for cover they rank in rushing per game over the last four weeks martin looked great last looks to be guy counting on to carry the offense george ten vs bengal defense most people have this image in of the bengal defense laying down against the run not so over four weeks only teams are tougher in allowing rushing yards maybe because teams choose to pass the ball where weak but the bottom line is teams run a tremendous amount on if steve is limited with a bad ankle and knee a team that runs the ball as their and option their style with a healthy george is a must start no slam dunk on the stewart det vs packer defense depending on the weather and ribs stewart could be asked to carry the load this week green is hurting on defense with dt steve warren the latest injured packer on the flip side playing pretty stingy rush rushing yards allowed per game over their last which hoover car vs chief defense with to his normal stay form displayed for most of hoover gets another shot this week the chiefs are tough at home weather could be a factor possibly in his favor but hoover will power rushing style into arrowhead and see how he fares kansas over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so pretty prentice white vs eagle defense neither of these doing a great job and both likely struggle against an eagle serious about defense if it were me look elsewhere my vs viking defense while under appreciated viking rush defense is pretty good over the last four weeks they in rushing yards allowed per game have all they want but the defense is one of the tougher will still a no brainer to start regardless of the opponent feeling ok with the knees although he admits to being them both coach mike has talked about using him on to help turn that unit patrick pass kevin ne vs bears defense still ailing the patriot situation is a mess and bill shedding much light on anything unless be probably shy away from all of them as too much of in the dark trying to predict the bears are playing rush defense with rookie sensation brian green vs lion defense one bright spot for the packers has been the outstanding play of green coach mike could have likely saved a pick on alexander if green was seattle always had the physical skills but he lagged behind areas now he seems to have brought the mental part of the game and the results are showing on the field a tough the lions rank over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed but i think up for sea vs bronco defense denver evidently take corey hanging a hall of fame type day on them several weeks ago been tough against the run since then over the last four rank in rushing yards allowed per game allowing just yards is a solid player and not unlike an smith made a living performing against the tough teams in tough games not like terrified of this just be aware a one thing you might want to consider is that coach mike at some point he wants to see more of rookie in the passing game how much like to see fletcher sd vs baltimore defense not go there is allowing an average of yards rushing per game over their games i see fletcher as the guy who breaks that moore chad morton terry allen no vs defense week both moore and morton were injured and feared to possibly game they appear to be healing ahead of schedule and now it both may play allen spent time running with the first unit so really murky right now tend to shy away from all as i think let aaron brooks throw the ball like he did last besides the are deceptively stingy against the rush ranking over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per vs titan defense yes this is a tough but denver and the jersey wore in that particular tough hanging in canton ohio i learned and i hope you did too to go young man pretty much regardless of the opponent tennessee is very defending the rush but i see very little way you could bench just lewis bal vs charger defense lewis is clearly the class of the crop offensively i hear some say they think his early season was actually a blessing as it let him stay fresh i know that but i do know running very hard and effectively he a tough this week against a charger defense rushing yards per game over the last games which earns them of still though you pretty much have to ride lewis if pit vs giant defense this could be a classic battle two big backs in ron and jerome lives for of games and get to lay it on the line sunday a in your league but the giants are tough against the rush over four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game feel good about starting if he were on my roster but you be aware likely be tough
