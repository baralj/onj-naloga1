leaves the start of schools slightly longer afternoon shadows jumping the gun i wait for this summer to be this summer the pounding never stops and as i hear the the cash register ringing with each climb in southwest temperature restricting transmission paths blown up interstate gas new mexico diminishing nox credits for instate power inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions and industrial customers credit limits restricting canadian power into the northwest and california and mw to cover its short hydro also get the willies every time another politician lambastes

oversight board if you ongoing study of the california market then not of these investigations save section investigation to amount to near nothing a lot of wasted time and paper and studies have their conclusion sections all finished need some evidence to support their how are we holding up under all of this how are you doing i many of you throughout the week and i know how frustrated you share your frustration you want to tell the public the press in between the truth you want to lay out the facts you show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market things worse not better the price caps for example and screwing up the prices much to the detriment of for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against now they are receiving higher average public going to listen to anything longer than a sound face it when it comes to stellar public relations is not known for turning in a performances except for guys seem to get their story in front of the public at i heard is putting on their bill is would have paid if the rate freeze ended but many of us new power industry borne from the loins of either the or business learned the hard way that the to a public inquiry is a head start in front of mob keep your head down shut your mouth and this too buy that approach at least not anymore that is i we have anything to hide or of which to be ashamed restructuring is about is correct beneficial to the in best interests look at it this way when they last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place for what do want to be remembered that you caved in to the political will or at a moment when you had the chance you did what was of what was expedient i think the choice is easy albeit sheer terror those bland homilies i so diligently teach my tell the truth do what is right think of the big picture just yourself are a lot easier to speak than to live by so and stand up for what you believe they take away your is this line up things in the republic of california excerpts from order on complaint the development of a block energy product odds and ends finish the story contest october general meeting what makes houston houston things in the republic of california excerpts from order on clinton commented from the rose garden that good folks in retired likely to vote for a democrat are between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes i the del monica beach lecture the instructed the the situation in california and wasted no response to august complaint whereby the utility to impose a price cap on generators in the region the in a way that i was hoping to see several months ago slammed on their complaint for lack of merit and the initiated an section investigation into the wholesale in this order we are denying requested of a price cap on all sellers in california however we consolidated hearing proceedings pursuant to section the federal power act to investigate the justness and the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy services to or through the california iso and and to whether the tariffs and institutional structures and the california iso and are adversely affecting the of competitive wholesale electric power markets in need to be concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels prevail in open competition ie sellers are able to bid prices significantly above their marginal costs that the volatility in imbalance energy prices erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication market is breaking down when it is moderately we find it appropriate to institute a section hearing issues we cannot implement an immediate price cap of by because there is no record before us to support action while the issues raised by this complaint the commission has no basis to conclude that place an immediate arbitrary cap on the price that utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into and iso markets would satisfy this standard has provided to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to power has not documented a single instance of a market power during times of scarcity and did not attempt that the conditions underlying the commissions approval rates for public utility sellers of energy and have changed nor did it address specific market factors that may be causing rates to be unjust asserts that the congestion management and are flawed and in need of overhaul furthermore its concern that for a number of reasons the and market reform efforts being pursued by iso not produce meaningful results indicates that it to work with the iso to develop alternative reform complains that the iso stakeholder process has judgment been ineffective with respect to these interveners contend that arguments are premature we agree with interveners the reform efforts have been the extensive public review and comment and are nearing we reject arguments at this is unclear whether failure to purchase hedging its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or decisions a retail rate design that exposes consumers to of commodity prices would be extraordinary particularly do not have the ability to receive or respond to are concerned that increasing level of market activity in market raises significant reliability and economical concerns historically the iso procures on a daily basis only the for the operating day not only does this procurement pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the but the practice is uneconomical such not subject to the buyers cap furthermore because the the supplier of last resort for these services when calls suppliers realize that the iso is in a an effort to address this problem we direct the iso to a more forward approach to procuring the resources reliably operate the grid specifically the iso should need for such additional resources based on forecasted we direct the iso to factor these reforms into an analysis need for and level of purchase price caps and to include as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase closing is an intervenor in the case and we hope to be in the case through testimony cross examination the filing and reply briefs things in the republic of california the development of a block energy weeks ago i discussed with the iso their interest in new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in of a trade day and be dispatched during the challenged them to let the market participants develop this of the iso doing the the august iso governing board meeting i stated as the that we oppose price caps but if the iso governing on going down the price cap route we would do whatever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of stage whereas i think about the conversation on markets as being relevant to the remarks before the it became painfully clear soon after that we could and with the iso to develop a new market through either apx or or both to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic market week and the iso had a joint meeting whereby both the merits of a block product and could be instituted the meeting at the iso at which had its members who either have generation in the state or import california was for market participants and the iso to discuss bring more order and price transparency to the out of the iso reported that this summer to date the amount of on out of market purchases was about million last year cost of out of market purchases was and in response to our earlier discussions with their proposals at the meeting the discussions which the course of the presentations focused on how the iso a to reduce the manpower requirements to satisfy its out of market telephone calls typically on and the interest on the part of market participants to make either the apx or proposed system for a were no commitments made by any party simply a willingness together to alleviate the problems associated with electric power during high demand periods with more participants and greater market keep you posted on our development of this i share bites of our burrito with fellow travellers much as last week when i sent my friend mike a copy of the the trial of jing mike sent me a note that i would like he said i could i want you to read it and appreciate that other people who share his view i also copied the response i michael aka old not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama story but i did want to offer an observation in people knew the other people that they did business with typically lived in the same community if a merchant tried exorbitant prices for his products even if he was the only town who had the product in stock he would face the wrath of citizens this undoubtedly served as a constraint on even in the absence of a or telling mrs jones loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her would a pleasant way to do business and such things ordinarily did the modern global economy of course this personal aspect of has been almost completely lost and so has the restraint no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people know many of them but they work in an environment where the of their business decisions are invisible if mrs jones to run her refrigerator any more that fact is at best and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of not a reason why a merchant would alter his is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism because occur within the overall context of a capitalist system something fundamental has changed and not for the better view now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out transaction their jobs may even depend upon it and no one for the end result is this the kind of world we want that in your burrito and see what your readers say you can me so that you are not accused of turning pink in your in the burrito and here is what i allude to the change in a world that was once institutional you make the point that things are not better off no other reason then the lack of personal accountability but think that in all cases the more personal world is lost it present as i will argue below second your group embraces when it is convenient finally and where will your and like minded when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand which in a handful of your essential point is not lost on me i do believe are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors i have a proposal below to which i would like to hear though the personal business touch is present in our economy the restraint to which your story pines in many of engagements which require financial give and take and vendor it is simply smart business to do so i have beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred checking accounts or when loan payments were made absent etc and the late fee forgiven however much of our certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires of markets nameless and faceless they do squeeze out all which lead to lower prices more innovation and a price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor producer the producer and consumer get out of the and leave it to others who are more skilled and find it ironic that turn then is so insistent on arguing as it on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation congestion management reform elimination of is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties trades on either side of a congested transmission path in of market efficiency lower prices for consumers does it if it is done through person to person transactions or your story can be used to make an alternative point to the merchant in town when moves into the next the road all the faithful customers that your merchant was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with more choice and lower prices what do you say then for us is direct the new generation owners moved of dollars into california at risk and took a chance off they succeeded as we all know this year and probably year and so on but the mw of new power plants in california and the mw under construction and the over mw of combined power projects arizona and southern nevada that are in line for change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized will soften returns will be less cherry and i really want where will accusers be when there is a shake will reap that benefit oh you best believe it but to which your opening story alludes simply misses that gotta make hay while the sun to my proposal michael i would be willing to work with you some kind of loan program for residential and small that would in effect reduce the economic hardship of prices i could imagine although i tested the any parties that a significant program could be crafted by the credit of participating generating companies by a commercial lending institution such as bank of would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative simply smart business not charity one way to amortize which came about due to a circumstance of short supply the sudden growth of demand for that is a step in the right direction i know one that it is no different than implementing a level for consumers true it is no different because in the customer is paying for the loan interest and and i consistently believe that a market for credit is am i getting impersonal than one instituted by second the security for these loans is provided by than the customers further we have to oversight and prudence reviews we could make this will be very interested to hear your thoughts and the comments of thanks for sending us your letter odds and ends finish the story there was only one response and that was from carl is what carl i missing something who is supposed to represent yes the pun in the name but is he also just an anonymous everyman there someone in first response to your question is that simply you could look it up i think its chinese for he takes out a concealed axe goes on a rampage and through the room drowning everyone and they lived happily the decided whether to name this response gilgamesh noah and
