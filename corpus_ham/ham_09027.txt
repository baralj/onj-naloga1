may have seen recent media reports on the topics of possible epa new source review regulation and legislation so was asked to conduct a review of and come up with recommendations for the larger bush national energy plan epa held several public hearings and solicited public comments which closed july submitted comments which i sent by email on epa has indicated that it will report to the president only on impacts of on the power sector on august and delay any specific recommendations for reform until in the past few days have suggested that findings will ease emissions standards on coal utilities such characterizations are as they are based on information coming from environmental oppose any reform but there is some substantive merit behind these reports as enforcement over plant modifications has been an extremely contentious issue for electric utilities and many industry sources have been lobbying hard to relax epa enforcement policy from an administrative perspective this is a relatively easy reform for epa to tackle it would only require a change in guidance and not a lengthy regulatory process or legislation as you can see from the attached stories environmental groups are extremely opposed to this type of action and are using the media very effectively to put pressure on epa against such loosening of enforcement will likely recommend a number of broader administrative and legislative changes to most requiring a longer trip through the legislative or regulatory process such changes could include reforms to analysis for new or existing sources relief for cleaner sources or standardization of some of the more arbitrary provisions of given the effort required these proposed reforms may be newsworthy but less likely to have an impact on the power sector in the of the recent complicating issues have been calls from other industry sectors manufacturers refining industrial boilers gas pipelines for relief epa would prefer to address power sector issues only but may be politically forced to make recommendations in other sectors as well it is not yet clear what sectors or what issues they will putting pressure on the administration on the modification enforcement issues the issue is the easiest solution to offer from a regulatory standpoint so despite environmental group opposition it that epa will recommend immediate action in this area along with reforms for businesses this means that coal emissions and power trading should expect renewed strength in the coal generation sector as older assets would face less barriers to extending their life origination opportunities plant upgrades capacity increases may increase as customers fears about enforcement actions subside industrial and gas pipeline sectors may see relief in the modification area as well if epa decides to tackle sectors outside just power particularly on gas pipeline issues turbine maintenance issues may be enough for epa to make a simple short term making news lately were statements by epa administrator christine whitman indicating that epa plans to release a proposal to scrap existing emissions regulations nox sip rule regional haze rain fora more streamlined plan strategies have been discussed for some time but are becoming more newsworthy lately because they were included as possible options under the bush energy plan and offer potential solutions to reform proposed elimination of existing air programs is not as drastic as in fact it offers the opportunity to replace confusing overlapping programs on multiple pollutants that are currently regulated or will soon be regulated by epa with a more certain and flexible system development of a trading plan that reforms are predictable however and will require a legislative effort september we expect to see release of plan as well as congressional consideration of several pieces of legislation working closely with epa the white house and congress on these issues and will continue to keep commercial and corporate groups informed on of strategies unless political dynamics change drastically we would not expect final action on year as the issue evolves we will be in touch with more specifics on the legislation and you have questions or would like more information please contact environmental dc office phone
