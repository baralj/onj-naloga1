crunch time in most fantasy seasons this is the week you back upon and say when i made the or was the put me over the most leagues have a game regular season heading down the stretch to that end tried my best to ramp a notch and make these capsules a little more detailed this along with the quick news sent yesterday all part of more than feature on target one of my favorite views for stats is to many times a player is the target of an intended pass a much number than receptions when predicting future performance as the true distribution tendencies a look at the first half of the season that i think find can see our week updated to avoid and exploit lets get to of luck to you this to avoid and game heres how i see the this week exactly where i rank to determine who to start just may be more favorable than another that doesnt id start the player with the best the info is be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by info thanks to for the data breakdown of fantasy by orleans passing game vs defense even with the stop anyone jeff crew gets to tee off on a defense an average of passing yards per game over the last four is dead last they make everyone look good and this week should be been up and down but this should be a week he rolls his best wr as keith is battling a neck an eye on horn as he suffered a sprained knee in game to return both he and practiced this week and should be good ricky be his best receiver though and should continue up great numbers san francisco ranks in fantasy points opposing diego passing game vs defense this week san diego faces a team in the defense ranks in passing per game over the past four weeks giving up yards per game as it may seem jim been a top fantasy over couple of weeks throwing for and yards in two games part is to figure out catch the passes in week curtis great games while te freddie factor then in week chargers had a bye in week it was back te as jones hauled in and yards on receptions i think continue to see the distribution lean towards what we saw last freddie jones as the primary target on a side note you have to refusing to answer questions from the reporter wearing a sweatshirt not only did he not answer the questions he got for having the gall to out to the charger complex wearing oakland passing game vs chief defense over the last three weeks has allowed passing yards per game suffering a from the where their explosive offense forces team catchup and throw the ball rich along with one of the nicer of the season the raider asleep last sunday night vs san diego but betting they get back normal self against the chiefs no offense to charger fans but to look past san diego on the schedule in their week for yards and tim the only wr to put up to speak of in that game receptions for yards but no td worth noting that both tyrone passes in the game james nice on a real team but probably starters in most te ricky dudley remains one of the most frustrating if hung with him this long probably worth on the chance he breaks out but been a huge disappointment bay passing game vs minnesota defense the minnesota defense king look great sunday betting have effect on brett this week the vikings pass defense ranks passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks they rank fantasy points allowed to opposing this year brett against miami last week failing to break the yard passing barrier a td minnesota brings a different quality defense than what last week though and likely have more success wr seems like the better fantasy choice than supposed freeman who managed a whopping receptions for yards still using two with bubba tyrone davis enough to diminish the value of the other ball well but his health remains a huge passing game vs bear defense the bears trail only when it comes to giving up fantasy points to opposing i love but peyton be the best faced yet chicago may be energized with jim miller starting at should have his way with the defense in fact miller may numbers as hopefully move the offense better than cade had wr marvin the clear go to guy terrence distant alternatives of course a deadly threat out of the backfield the are call as both ken effective pollard had game last week but tough to depend city passing game vs raider defense these are two very teams that give up way too many yards through the air kansas averaging passing yards per game allowed over the past four the raiders are yielding yards per game over that span elvis one of the nicer stories of and he ought to continue his this one threw for yards and in their week the wr and provides great stability rookie sylvester last game and the air for this week of course the big gun for kc is te tony had receptions for yards and a td in their last passing game vs ram defense wesley walls or no wesley walls still are giving up passing yards per game over the last four that lands them squarely in the slot again much of this is driven by the fact st louis forces team to throw the ball but not really important all important is that teams do throw on the rams and effectively steve will sorely walls but have to find someone to take up the slack physical donald hayes and muhammad were pushed around by the falcon corners and let that happen again look for to play an even bigger role catching the ball out his looking better and he should be able to go the is still muddy kris shoulder is still a big brian is more valuable as the long snapper rookie could get the start pay attention because st louis gives fantasy points to the te than all but one other team in the passing game vs patriot defense patriot lb andy was on injured reserve this week and got to hurt even with patriots had been pretty weak in defending the pass over the weeks they ranked in passing yards allowed per game in points allowed to opposing doug comes into this for the job coach wade and even have rob job but i feel another strong game could earn him the right to keep starting impossible to johnson takes enough sacks in one game to make an films for all eric moulds he grabs a huge percentage of which is the perfect scenario for fantasy jeremy ahead of peerless price but neither are starter material in te jay made his return last week and huge both and passing game vs lion defense detroit enters this game with a allowing passing yards per game over the last four that earns them a ranking when ranked by number of allow opposing they rank jay has been making great plays followed by awful throws have as cornerback been on a tear of late and leslie shepherd catch most all of the passes smith catch many balls and the are a non factor keep an eye ribs as they were giving him a lot of trouble before the passing game vs colt defense indianapolis continues their louis great wr with a porous defense defense is a help as it keeps the passing game alive instead the offense to go into its preferred ground game to control defense ranks in fantasy points allowed to this season while indianapolis ranks in other words expect jim miller takes over the reins and be interesting how he responds reportedly looked excellent in practice and seems energized with his presence cade is regarded by many who received preferential treatment from the is the blue collar guy and seems to have the players behind him robinson is of course the prime target remember he excelled no matter who threw the ball to him look for miller to lean on white brooks and eddie should all see action but any wr past robinson is tough is the te john and still learning the england passing game vs buffalo defense the bills pass defense a little shaky lately giving up an average of passing yards over the last four weeks that ranks drew has week to prepare for the bills and a game both teams desperately win played pretty well the last couple of games but his a little inflated with rushing that you certainly wr terry glenn was red hot early but has cooled a bit troy brown simmons have been cutting into production for what been talk of moving te eric to wr which his numbers any jr and kevin are both dangerous passing game vs charger defense not overly excited about and crew but the charger defense has to rate as a good after their improved performance against the raiders last week ranks in fantasy points allowed to this year over the weeks averaging passing yards per game allowed which jon gets the start as brock is still feeling affects of a concussion he suffered a couple of weeks ago me that a player this young is taking so long to be cleared although hes reportedly feeling better today and may be able to week the troubles end there as ricky is listed as with a bad toe a huge help for the passing game catching the ball but in keeping the defense honest against the run jackson is a promising player but it appears yield to get the start along with sean is reportedly for the first time in a long while if going to play would probably be the week te christian caught a td last maybe waking up like i said i expect too much out of but they do have a solid passing game vs packer defense over the past four weeks defense has allowed passing yards per game not awful puts them well below average at they rank in allowed to the opposing for the year is one of his worst games against a tough tampa defense yet he still put numbers worthy of a starter this week have a much easier go facing green bay just like most thought cris carter seems to more passes than randy moss while moss is more the home they both have over the last three games so you guy start both without worry robert smith will get back on after being held down by the which is nothing to be ashamed has yet to find a consistent passing game vs miami defense hard to add up sam patrick are thought to be two of the better corners in yet they rank in passing yards per game over the last if you look a little closer see they rank in allowed to the opposing for the year charlie batch about like we thought he would not very good up and just enough flashes to get folks excited only to be his once thought to be a strength of depth are now thin germane is gone and herman moore is nursing a foot it looks like johnnie morton is the only healthy guy he you get excited about brian and larry foster is a fine runner and starting to become more involved as te davis sloan might be a starter in a team league but just louis passing game vs panther defense over the last four weeks has been pretty effective defending the pass allowed passing per game over that stretch which is been in the fantasy points allowed to the opposing where they rank for the year this is st louis though trent green steps in with under his belt he was clearly more comfortable in the nd half game and mike admitted he may have been a little with green early even though he made pregame statements that be i look for continued production from him for is the guy green hooked up with him for receptions last bruce it looks like holt and hakim will catch both those guys are decent starters if not loaded ricky is up and down sometimes a wr for a team like can equal the numbers from a poor team marshall to put on a clinic with both his rushing and receiving green complete a pass to his te sunday passing game vs bengal defense the bengals come hand it to new coach dick got these guys playing the past three games their defense has allowed passing yards for a ranking of the big difference is in the bengal rush they now rank in rushing yards allowed over the previous back in week they were ranked in rushing yards allowed previous games nice work coach this fired up defense faces team absolutely dying to score a td trent start again true to coach brian prediction a pace and did give the team a spark at times at times he pretty bad too see if another week of practice with the helps will be the prime target and patrick the injured travis taylor in a case of what goes around comes broken collarbone was the exact injury that knocked earlier and allowed taylor to start the guy i keep thinking is te shannon clearly the best receiver on the you know this drought has to be killing him if you saw him on halloween party doing the austin powers thing scariest costume i year you heard him say he was hoping no one recognized him as a player he predicted it would be an the once the started passing game vs jets defense the jets are playing decent late allowing an average of passing yards per game over the last which nets them a ranking of they rank in fantasy to the for the year after a bye week denver comes into hoping for a fresh start after chewing on the humiliating loss for two weeks much has been made of brian drinking troubles but i doubt affect his game play sunday he the in the league over the last three weeks in fantasy points in those two games thrown for an amazing yards and him as usual both rod smith and ed are solid plays comes in picking a te as denver has not one not two but three clark dwayne and byron chamberlain all from a fantasy football perspective denver would be much with just one te catching all the te passes but noticed the real guys pay very little attention to our desires the big news for will be the comeback of davis few players get to make in one season but davis will give it a york jets passing game vs denver defense vinny and the one of the toughest teams to predict they just seem to throw a often than not either surpassing or falling short of that said they face a perplexing denver defense that ranks yards allowed over the last weeks yet they only rank points allowed by the opposing for the year vinny off a solid outing last week where he completed of for yards and he seems to finally be getting his wr tandem of wayne coles had a great game last week catching passes for a sure starter and probably roll the dice on coles as and fred baxter have both scored from the te position weeks but you count on them i have learned this about trust anything johnson says about fellow when went san diego told my friend steve cohen who covered for in that graham would be a top wr in the and year all we heard from johnson was how ward was the wr in just so you bay passing game vs falcon defense atlanta ranks in passing allowed per game over the last four weeks yet for the year they in fantasy points allowed to see if king the roll week was a pivotal week for this offense as four hour talk to johnson at house the tampa specifically he seemed recharged in getting the ball a shocker johnson would want the ball i worked of a jets game for radio and my buddy steve cohen a couple ago and have a different view of than many do yes the ball but i think he wants it not so much for personal glory wants it because he knows how good he is and truly believes the team best chance to win when they go to him either way it seems king will continue with what worked last week beginning the ball to johnson even in double coverage green from the extra attention paid to but be careful to the ball is spread around only had one reception but it was good for a td look for more of list i wanted to give you a sample of the type of information what we thought this morning when we ranked jeff george and johnson on our week johnson out jeff george george was named the washington redskins starting quarterback game at turner said george would start after brad johnson was unable thursday for a second consecutive day johnson sprained a in monday nights loss to tennessee george missed to attend the birth of his son his third child signed a million contract in april to back he has yet to play a down this season and has taken only about of the snaps in practice had a very good practice today turner said hes into it in what were doing the redskins have a bye after the arizona game are uncertain whether johnson will be able to return for the game a monday night trip to st got a pretty tender knee trainer bubba said grade be two weeks could be four weeks further complicating the offensive preparation for this week three receivers are suffering injuries with irving the most serious who wednesday because of a injury returned thursday questionable for practiced despite a sore right shoulder and is probable thrash also practiced despite a strained thigh muscle and is roster now might be the time to consider him not overly as arizona has a pretty tough pass defense over the last they rank in passing yards allowed per game for the rank in fantasy points allowed by the opposing so as tough there this could likely be an audition for as george is the redskin of the future a strong performance cause problems for the remainder of this year as washington tries out the position albert and james thrash are as probable and should be good to go at this point in the is larry centers does such a nice job catching the ball the backfield that te stephen alexander has been ineffective passing game vs buccaneer defense tampa bay gave up yards last week and td pretty solid they rank passing yards allowed over the last four weeks and when sorted points allowed by opposing for the year chris poorly last week but his mind was certainly on his father in brodie who is recovering from a stroke i look at it this way brings a much more dangerous passing game than do the falcons tampa could hold them in check likely do the same with is the primary receiver with tim dwight making home run appearance shawn jefferson after a solid start season has really tailed off reggie kelly is only an average passing game vs eagle defense this summer dallas featured in their training camp than just about any other franchise what weeks can make joey gone and troy a shadow of his former self with randall at square off against a philadelphia team that ranks in fantasy allowed by opposing for the year they rank in passing over the last four weeks sitting this one out may not altogether bad thing for the cowboys as has moved the at times james and will handle the te jackie harris has been their most productive receiver with although get too excited about harris as the eagles are league for fantasy points allowed to opposing francisco passing game vs saints defense as you know a big fan but this is a tough for the new orleans ranks over the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per game and they for the year in fantasy points allowed to opposing couple that fact new orleans is playing very well of late with their ball led by ricky williams and it could be a tough game still hard to dismiss a guy like been just red hot for a the over the last three games throwing for and you hear anyone talking too much about it because the winning but putting together a season that statistically steve young envious wr is the best wr in the game big physical and most importantly incredible after the looks like a man among boys out there jerry rice as into guy yes that still sounds strange if you can think any of those three guys teams so loaded you probably any help from me charlie garner is one of the best tremendous catching the ball the only real weak link is that just means more opportunity for the other york giant passing game vs cleveland defense the cleveland simply yield many yards or fantasy points through the browns rank in passing yards allowed over the last four weeks by fantasy points allowed by opposing the browns rank year you could theorize that teams simply have to throw the rush defense is weak and the cleveland offense much the as important as the and teams roll up many passing stats against cleveland is coming off a nice week where he threw for yards and predicted wr amani would respond in a positive manner to his benching in his previous game call yards and a td a ike is a fine wr and a nice complement to been a good bit of talk that is the better wr but i my faith in te pete mitchell is still a huge to what we thought do against the brown defense i think see heavy doses of ron and tiki barber which should limit the passing passing game vs dallas defense dallas is but the defense is playing well over the last four rank in passing yards allowed per game for the year as strong in the fantasy points allowed by department where they rank donovan coming off a poor game last week where he of passes for yards and td but the cowboys off a game where they allowed the struggling jaguars to throw for still i think the favors the defense here charles the with johnson being the only guy at one worrisome note is the fact defenses have figured out how down te chad been on fire coach andy reid says do things with lewis so teams as able to bracket him the are mess and be counted on for much relief in the passing passing game vs steeler defense rates as defense in the league when it comes to fantasy points allowed by not good news for steve struggling defenses much less one as tough as they also rank passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks if is you normally consider for your look elsewhere if solid starter the titan are a mess out if you cut him by now not paying derrick mason and chris sanders are the likely starters thrown in the mix outside of mason have a hard time any of these guys the one receiver i have no hesitation is te frank as solid as ever and is having a with so far clearly the favored target for a small bright spot ranks in fantasy points they rank in fantasy points allowed to but against just average ranking what does this mean it means your best bet for titan receiver this passing game vs raven defense i remember a team history with such a disparity between the offense and defense offensive woes are well documented as they went for october in department at the same time the defense is squashing people could be ugly as they take out some frustration on the bengal baltimore is ranked over the last four weeks in passing per game they also rank in fantasy points allowed by a tough time moving the ball against the guys i doubt suddenly become a good this sunday the primary wr but been stifled worth desperate just because a guy who can make something happen he touches the ball but i like the for the passing te tony a total non factor this unit is all about running the passing game vs giant a case of an awful offense up against a pretty good defense over the last four weeks rank in passing yards allowed per game those stats should be a bit after facing the dynamic passing duo of doug and wynn i actually like some of the things seen wynn do but got a long way to go kevin johnson david catch what passes there are to be caught but with the possibly johnson reaching there te aaron not a passing game vs redskin defense ripped jake plummer week this season and not stopping now just not very all got excited including yours truly after his scorching hot half statistics are often a great indicator of the year any of you who drafted plummer last year likely have a of how effective half stats are in predicting i heard lots of folks say that the season was a fluke really better than that i think time we faced the his half was the fluke and what seeing now is it david frank handle the wr duties a tough washington pass defense not excited about washington ranks in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks and they earn an ranking in fantasy points allowed thomas likely see plenty of action with hurting and he does catch the ball well on a positive terry a great game sunday with receptions for yards and a passing game vs titan defense tennessee enters this as well as any team in the league much of their success can to their defense over the last four weeks they rank yards allowed per game since the beginning of the season in fantasy points allowed by opposing a defense for a like face some feel better on the road but been to coliseum and i any plays better on the road there be throwing the ball ward bobby i see any of as starters unless in a huge league the steelers will to do what they do best pound jerome i expect to pass too often and when they do i expect them to have much game heres how i see the this week exactly where i rank players and to determine who to start just may be more favorable than another that doesnt id start the player with the best the info is be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between davis was vs cardinal defense much will be made of jeff his first start as a redskin as i mentioned above in the passing not all that excited as the cardinals play pretty good pass more importantly they play horrible rush defense over the games they rank in rushing yards allowed for the year more fantasy points to than any other team in the league jeff george to lean heavily on stephen davis as he settles into the tiki barber vs brown defense much like arizona feature an offense that score too many points and a defense which is the result of opposing teams choosing the safer running the ball few coaches will pass up the chance to run the the defense readily allows it the browns readily allow it they rank in rushing yards allowed and in fantasy points allowed by opposing think could have a big game here as the giants should to remain in control struggles in the games where the playing from behind and i just see that happening martin vs bronco defense nothing like a corey rushing day to skew the stats over the last four weeks denver last in rushing yards allowed per game with in reality that bad at least i think so be willing to bet coach had the team work more than once on the basics of tackling get a good test against one of the best in the league in this game might actually deserve to slide down to the prime but i want to see how denver responds on james ind vs bear defense chicago comes out of the bye week must face the explosive colts after a few sputters james as well as any back in the league right now chicago ranks yards allowed over the last four games for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to opposing brian a few problems for james but i look for indy to roll williams no vs defense like i need to tell you to williams roll san rush defense is almost as their pass defense and their pass defense is world class bad i got a yard rushing day in him this year and it surprise this is the week got a sore right shoulder and right knee this week and expected to mike tb vs falcon defense johnson the minnesota game last week that he told king he needed the ball to his best players and being of course whether this was a backhanded swipe at i know know kicked his game up a notch sunday rushing for yards on and catching a yard td played well too gaining on carries and most importantly no fumbles the falcons rank rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks for the year they in fantasy points allowed by davis den vs jets defense i may optimistic but excited about return to many players get to make two comebacks in one year banking character of the broncos and that bounce back with a the embarrassing loss to the bengals in their last game td looked as good as he ever has and should be ready to lead the way still likely be spelled by mike anderson but i think see the bulk of the vs panther defense coach mike called himself the other day when he failed have a backup kicker active to the injured jeff that stupid but be hard to define calling future hall of reggie white the end of his three days before playing him as stupid coach the defending world champs whenever you open your mouth think first angry reggie or should still have a good day carolina ranks for the year points allowed to opposing over the last four weeks they in rushing yards allowed fletcher kenny robert chancey deuce vs seattle defense just making sure you attention the chargers could use a model means or deuce but that happening this week a shame defense is awful they rank in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks and in fantasy points allowed to get a hunch one of these guys may see significant time jump on it guessing more committee for this amp lee vs cowboy defense this one frustrating the team that move the ball on the ground against the team that stop anyone on the ground dallas is points allowed by this year also in allowed over the last four weeks but carry the ball for is a keep an eye on it to see if one guy but right now a great with no one to take anderson vs buccaneer defense anderson seems to the corner running hard and having good success last rolled up yards on carries this week he faces a tampa probably not quite as tough as their reputation the rank rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks they rank points allowed by chris chandler should have his mind football this week so hopefully provide a little morris shawn vs patriot defense the patriots game with a defense ranked in rushing yards allowed over the weeks they also rank in fantasy points allowed by for both are solid tough runners who can grind out the tough patriot lb corps took a hit this week with andy going to but got plenty of talent there in ted johnson chris slade smith mia vs detroit defense smith has been one of the nicer of as he continues to run hard and productively the in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks and points allowed be opposing for the year detroit secondary are playing solid defense and likely the dolphins be forced to the lewis bal vs bengal defense you have to hand it to new coach the bengals are improved on defense and are playing with few weeks ago cincinnati ranked in rushing yards allowed now up to a very respectable a nice change lewis is the bit though the offensive troubles are well documented but matter of time before they break loose inclined to agree with who said he thought the would come in bunches once the first couple out of the way in their first meeting this ran for yards and a smith dal vs eagle defense you can make a good case for this and with out this is one of those times on the other hand eagles play solid run defense ranking in rushing yards allowed last four weeks they rank in fantasy points allowed by allen chi vs colt defense james allen continues his quest fans forget about curtis been a decent player over the weeks but needs to up the level of his play get a chance to against a colt team struggled at times over the last few colt rank in rushing yards allowed they rank in allowed to for this season the bears are looking for a jim miller and they very well may get oak vs chiefs defense with tyrone likely significant time this week coach jon sounds confident ability to carry the load the chiefs rank in allowed to this year they rank in rushing yards allowed the last four weeks i be surprised to see post numbers here in green vs viking defense with nursing a bad looks like green will carry the load against minnesota i think the task minnesota ranks in rushing yards allowed per game last four weeks while they rank in fantasy points allowed the showed last week that minnesota can be run car vs ram defense interested to see team looks like without te wesley walls thinking take up some slack in the short passing game where already the rams rank in rushing yards allowed over the last but in fantasy points allowed by opposing for was nursing a sore knee early this week but he should to go sunday better be as brad hoover is now his smith min vs packer defense after a relatively quiet game tampa bay sunday i look for smith to come out blazing against the green bay ranks in rushing yards allowed over the last they also rank in fantasy points allowed by opposing has the speed to exploit parts of the packer defense and i think see him have some anders frank tony richardson vs raider defense too against a tough defense spell ff success the raiders tough defending the run ranking in rushing yards allowed over four weeks of the bunch put my money on anders if i had just one alexander ricky vs charger defense ricky iron could be in jeopardy as in danger of missing time with a of turf toe rookie alexander may get the start could give it to to keep the streak alive i great things from either guy as the charger run defense is solid in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks and points allowed by for the year stewart det vs dolphin defense james stewart is starting to get untracked but he may hit an obstacle against miami this week zach thomas the dolphins are tough and will make things on stewart miami ranks in rushing yards allowed over the weeks they rank in fantasy points allowed by opposing year vs raven defense the ravens rank in the league yards allowed over the last four weeks they rank for allowed by corey comes into this game with over his last two games got to give betting to be but why they play the game in their gained a whopping yards on jones michael vs redskin defense ribs and could be limited sunday jones will start if washington ranks in rushing yards allowed over the last four the redskins are even tougher when sorted by fantasy points opposing where they come in for the year looks like the rushing game could be in prentice vs giants defense travis prentice sure seems running hard without a lot to show for it i think his to change this weekend as he faces a tough giant defense new in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and fantasy points allowed by opposing for the year well right now to let cleveland hang with garner sf vs saints defense if a regular reader of this you know a big charlie garner fan but this is saints are shutting people down they rank in rushing over the last four weeks and in fantasy points allowed by the year got to slide garner down the list a bit against still a starter and with his explosiveness still liable a great day but the is tough this kevin ne vs bills defense should get and work primarily on and nd down will likely be down back it may not matter a whole lot as the bills defense buffalo ranks in rushing yards allowed over the last they rank in fantasy points allowed by opposing for the george ten vs steeler defense assuming he gets over his toe and injuries eddie george is a sure starter unless just but i do not like this ranks in allowed by in their week george was held to which was the lowest complete game total for the season thus defense is playing with confidence and likely be in holding george down from his normal lofty pit vs titan defense the last time tennessee faced a power back like was ron in week had yards in that contest tennessee ranks in rushing over the last four weeks they fall in at in fantasy points by opposing the steelers have few other weapons outside so look for them to give it a go did rush for yards td in their week
