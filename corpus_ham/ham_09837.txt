repudiation far from the covetous plans of the for crossing afghanistan with pipelines rich with oil and as the biggest single economic event of the century with more oil and gas than saudi fabled reserves the project was a dollar pipeline bringing gas from the prime reserves across afghanistan to the huge indian and pakistan markets another pipeline would have carried oil from the caspian in the project faced defeat as the civil rights and feminist lobby in the united states took on the oil giants over the suppression of human rights by the fervent islamic clerics and mullahs of the they wrested the attention of the united nations and forced the hand of then president bill clinton notwithstanding years of pressure by and its array of consultants clinton declared that the repression of

forward lane says and we were always an advocate on rights and we pressured them the at the time he insists thats not the way the very influential us lobby group the feminist majority remembers it this organisation rallied women and trade unions across america and galvanised hollywood to rally for afghan rights in the end the speculation about the continued pressure by oil companies on us foreign policy in afghanistan has been fed by the publication of a new book which alleges that the oil giants stayed george ws hand on investigating terrorism this year while they tried one last round

after a federal bureau of investigation warning that bin laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against north american natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death industry sources said

companies are hoping to present a proposal to producers by yearend if and when an agreement is reached with the producers the companies will move forward with the alaskan portion of the us companies involved in the project include williams duke energy energy international corp el paso corp while pipelines energy and foothills pipe lines represent the canadian parties the signing of the mou is significant because it shows a renewed interest in eliminating the historic and other commercial roadblocks to building the project according to our of the companies are the original partners in the alaskan northwest natural gas transportation co which was designed by the president and us congress to build and operate the alaskan portion of the project in the companies dropped out of the project years ago even though the federal energy regulatory commission had already received approval for the project numerous other federal permits for the construction and operation of the alaskan natural gas transportation system are already in place the statutory framework for the project provides for a quick approval of the remaining permits needed before construction can is a big step forward in bringing alaskas natural gas to markets in the lower said alaska senator frank i always have believed that construction of an alaskan gas transportation system to the lower is going to take the

trading at a distressed level of cents on the s dow jones christina cheddar dow jones sign investors dont trust michael jones news c dow jones company inca dow jones york dow jones if you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust corp heres another piece of evidence one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the doesnt simply trade for less than its book value it fell below that milestone weeks ago no now it trades for less than of its book a rare level for a company of size and prominence and it may mean among other things that investors have decided that they simply cant place any further faith in the veracity of earnings and figures as theyve been something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company lets be clear about what this means stock is currently about a share the reported book value is about a share in other words stock sells for less than of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate were to turn all its assets into cash pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give whats left over to is an uncommonly dismal level for any company even a troubled one for comparisons sake inc dyn which has agreed to buy trades at about three times book value as does el paso corp a competitor of both companies in fact has the ratio of any company in the standard index only inc another troubled company is lower by an of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that agreement to buy will fall apart and the belief that will have to file for bankruptcy if it does in which case shareholders would be to realize any value the deal now amounts to about per share itself well under book value the huge premium that level offers over current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal wont be consummated in its current given current woes its certainly also possible that is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors dont feel they can trust the earnings and numbers coming out of those numbers after all are the raw material that form the basis for valuing or any other company by computing figures like and the debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers with shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted in terms of those numbers the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships when it restated nearly five years worth of earnings downward by a total of million and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a million note that deadline has now been extended until dec youve gotten punched in the face three times its not unreasonable to fear therell be a fourth blow no matter how much the puncher assures you there wont be given insanely complicated structure and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks who can guarantee there arent more such shocks yet to what investors appear to be fearing and that may be part of the reason stock has fallen so precipitously thanks to repeated demonstrations that its numbers cant be relied on investors no longer have a firm trustworthy basis on which to value the stock and so not surprisingly the value is getting down to the most conservative spokesman couldnt be reached for ironic in a way for a long time it was hard to properly value because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher now its hard to properly value because the attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that its hard to
