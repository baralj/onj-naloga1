sees cold winter united states can expect another winter with temperatures similar to last winter the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said in its winter outlook confirming recent private forecasts most notably that of salomon smith barney meteorologist jon davis earlier this most of the united states winter will feel like a sequel to last years cold season said with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation including heavy snows in the northeast and midwest cold air outbreaks in the south and the potential for along the east said the absence of a strong el or la climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold snow rain and ice that the nation may dont expect a repeat of the cold temperatures of of last year but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late said scott gudes acting administrator citizens should prepare for the full range of winter factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season they include the arctic oscillation which influences the number of outbreaks in the south and on the east coast and the oscillation which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the pacific winter improving technologies will help national weather service forecasters for the first time pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather said jack kelly director of national weather temperatures are expected in the northeast snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the arctic oscillation the states have equal chances of above normal normal or temperatures and precipitation storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late but this largely depends on the arctic oscillation said the southeast should be drier than normal temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal normal or below the upper midwest and great lakes temperatures should be lower than normal with more subzero days than the average of recent winters there are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal normal or below normal the northern great plains and rockies should see temperatures with more subzero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern central rockies can expect equal chances of above normal normal or precipitation and temperatures in the northwest there are equal chances for above normal normal or rain and snow heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters a repeat of the dryness seen last winter is unlikely said to expect temperatures in most of the southwest except western california and equal chances of above normal normal or precipitation
