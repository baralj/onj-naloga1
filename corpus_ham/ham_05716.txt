image image vs in san diego dec brown who covers texas football for the dallas morning your questions about the holiday bowl uts quarterback situation draft picks mack brown and more inside ut football appears listen to chip brown talk about the longhorns colleges buy all your ut team gear at our of the most intriguing to watch in this years at san diego will take place on the sidelines with texas coach going up against mike you may not know much about but know this about his tenure in six years he has a record and those wins are more other school during that time period and over the last oregon is with four consecutive bowl game appearances two losses this season were by a combined total of points wisconsin and at oregon state brown certainly is impressed by success at mike is a personal friend brown said in a news release information office he took over for rich brooks at oregon a years ago when they were representing the in the rose bowl for time in a long time he has done a great job building on that of his years as head coach it will be fun to be around him and his the week into one of the premiere football programs in the country the dec against texas will increase an already exciting rivalry and the big longhorn fans can purchase tickets to the holiday bowl the ut ticket office or by to the athletics department web site prefer to play in but were any of their options less desirable dates travel ticket sales or impressing todd bowl i know that sounds like well of course thats what say but the coaches were trying to motivate the team before game by saying if ut won out they would go to the holiday bowl sunny destination against a top team aside from the beach balls the ut players wanted to go to san diego because they are by the from their hometowns to get to the bowl game chris was paid by the to get from new jersey cotton bowl last year so hell really clean up this year not that it but you get the picture its a way for some of the players to nice little chunk of change because what many of them will do is take money from the and then try to buy a cheaper airline ticket the rest the players are responsible for getting to san diego own the team will not charter a flight all players have to into the team hotel in san diego by pm on dec mack to go to the holiday bowl from the time it appeared oklahoma would big south because he knew it would give texas a chance to play a team and he wants his team excited and pumped up to play a surging year texas and its fans couldnt seem to get fired up for an arkansas team in the cotton bowl one year after having played in game so believe it when ut says the holiday bowl is where it wanted casey hes a cinch first rounder could he go in the top five be more likely because there are so many highly touted coming out this year but has been really watching his trying to improve his speed he promised me that scouts at the will be surprised see him work out is a great story the guy just works his and knows that his height slightly more than will probably him so he is going to try to blow scouts away in every other as he told me in a story that the dallas morning news and before the texas the film dont lie if you can show me where has hurt me its on you i would be surprised if fell to fiesta bowl bowl which one does not cold chills just to think about bowl a name that still haunts the independence texas meet up with former coach jackie this year to hope the furniture bowl which will be played in the fairs better than the old bluebonnet bowl which went bankrupt to pay texas and their purses for the game won by that was the last bowl game ever played in houston by the rotation scheme now however the is real texas now has two genuine starting quarterbacks is no longer the next boy wonder he has arrived does anyone in have a better quarterback tandem than texas how in the world is going to deal with this if they keep the simplified offensive year do you think the rotation could resurface and actually rogers salary because of the quarterback situation and hell earn every next year unless unforseen circumstances such as injuries i think it will be difficult for chris to redshirt and i think it will be difficult for the coaches not to start year he won the job because of an injury to major just won the job because of an injury to richard if starts game and texas plays well and wins will have done nothing the job and would probably go into the spring and fall as the texas flounders under in the bowl game and needs to and relieve him then we are back to square one with both guys out in the spring and fall to see who is the starter texas coaches they were more comfortable with coming off the bench because of his experience so well see if their stance has validation of abilities and an indictment of the chris made that play happen because he had played down in the game to that point and knew the tendencies of player responsible to my mind that is a strong argument kind of rotation scheme but on the other hand how can one not play both of these immensely talented quarterbacks as much as we get a rule change to allow two footballs on the field at once year is that should have more confidence and thus should he is on the field but his comments all season have directly indicated that he hated the rotation and that his come around until he was taking all the snaps so i dont know if are willing to put him through that again and risk losing mack brown the season that you picked texas tech for the upset over the seemed to be an indictment on mack browns ability to fire up the that texas has more talented players i think that he has he can win big games but he has also had some surprising slipups unquestionably a great recruiter but do you question his on andrew lose any game we play i just dont know which team is going to we could go or those kinds factored into my thinking when picking texas tech to beat brown is as adept at public relations and communication as ive been around so when he was saying things like that it made if this team was ever going to develop an identity clearly this a tough year in terms of leadership on the field on offense the fine with casey leading the charge but the offense to find an identity part of that was the quarterback of it was having young receivers and part of it was having a bunch with personalities ie mitchell leonard davis derrick mike williams etc mack brown even said the quietest bunch of offensive players hed been around once mack co decided to simplify the offense and designate major as brown was making a plea to the offense for leadership as much think mack brown is a great coach let me say that again he is a i think this year was a test of his finding and developing the field the more he rotated the the less chance the offense had an identity because the young receivers were clearly struggling their responsibilities in as well as trying to adjust two coming in and out of the huddle the offensive linemen also struggled with gap schemes and just hitting the guy in front of sure the coaches thought the offense would come together more it did mack brown has already gone back and said that he wished more in the stanford game an outing in which until the fourth quarter against oklahoma the sooners early and texas got hit with a punch it couldnt get up from the first inexcusable loss of the mack brown era and ended his austin according to mack brown is smart enough and charming enough to have the fans of his hand any time he wants all he has to do is tune out the he hears reported in the media or on the internet and simply are doing the best we can we learn we make mistakes were going trying harder those are comments no negative fan can argue brown became upset with the negative voices and let it about this season each press conference was filled with a how the media and fans had beat up this years team it mack brown uses joe as his role model often hates the media rarely gives out interviews etc so if mack following in footsteps on that issue it would be a doesnt have the public relations savvy of mack got tough questions during his radio show this season he hid his contempt for them better than others but a guy like good enough and smart enough that he should just let this stuff roll his back use that laugh of his and then take out in the meeting and film rooms while finding ways to turn into a juggernaut mack brown should know his teams personality next year because so many players will be back and hell have this a blueprint of how not to do things in many instances and hes where to be at a major college football power and always being in of favorite at north carolina as well as he recruited and state was always going to be the bully in the neighborhood at had beaten nebraska the first two times he played them and showed was going to be the new bully in the big now oklahoma has past the longhorns and bob stoops has done everything if you notice stoops didnt gripe about having to play the big game and possibly ruin his teams national title chances he about the cold weather that everyone said would do in the sooners city he has a tough attitude and his team has adopted his has a tough attitude too and against oregon in the holiday bowl of next season will be the truest test of browns coaching and expectations brown said fairly and accurately that texas couldnt to win the national title this year because the longhorns a season in the top since how do you jump to no first been in the top brown said before the season does of talk trickle into the ears of players i dont know most of before the season and included felt like win the national title thats one of the biggest reasons to texas this season when ut lost to stanford brown emerged from blasted locker room and said i didnt think this was a team he went on to say the team was too young are these excuses team if texas beats oregon in the holiday bowl the longhorns will top finish and will once again be ranked in the top heading defense the big question mark will be at defensive tackle because and rogers will be moving on but adam lee provide an ample foundation to rebuild at the position and should only get better and there is a wealth in the seven guys behind them on offense the big question mark is back where mitchell is moving on hes a guy some texas think is worthless but let me tell you he isnt hes got guts everything he had it may take some time to see another back who and run the way he does ut will have several backs to pick cedric benson the rest of the team is proven pick up bo scaife at tight dont see any excuses for this team next year national championship be all over this team like sunshine in bermuda heres hoping that doesnt let the nitpickers bog him down and i include myself in of nitpickers because reporters are paid to point out all of the reports fed to him about negative internet postings and any angles in a newspaper story heres to hoping that hell take questions with the ease and charm he shows publicly on a places like texas alabama and ohio state have fans who are satisfied until brown wins a national championship ut fans and doubt and wonder why something else wasnt tried that even if he wins a national title but thats sports its worse there is more coverage of sports than ever before with the talk radio mack brown lives under a microscope fans think as smart as coaches because they manage a fantasy football team has to shrug off the and focus on the reasons he to see significant playing time next year the more i think he has the best chance to have an impact next appears to have the kind of vision that makes running backs and all the top five teams had a sub rating given that ut chance in the national championship race next year what if could go undefeated and still be on the outside looking in andrew oklahoma i think its fair to say that strength of schedule is for texas next year i think texas has to win all its games to make sure that it is not in the position of miami which state but is not in the national championship picture if texas next season the longhorns could very well not be in control of destiny with their schedule as crazy and this sounds the longhorns would probably need to win all the games getting a shot at the national championship next leonard davis the seniors from the bowl game will any juniors declare early looking at any underclassmen on the team lance grand prairie rogers ss greg brown may also get a look from an team after he has had i think davis is a pick for sure shouldnt fall past the second they could simply because there are a number of top in next years draft scouts are intrigued by junior because of his size and physical play at cornerback scouts lewis speed and size at linebacker but ut officials that no underclassmen will jump from this years team the mississippi state cotton bowl with a different philosophy than the arkansas cotton bowl what is our attitude about oregon holiday bowl keith season that team was riding the euphoria of ricky trophy and felt like it was on top of the world the team that in last cotton bowl had lost two straight and then back in dallas feeling a little unsure about itself against team looking for its first bowl victory since this is riding a winning streak finally got the breakout game looking for from chris and really wants to win its bowl game in the top for the first time in years i would be surprised surprised if texas comes out flat and doesnt make a good showing holiday bowl even though they dont know much about oregon know the ducks are ranked higher than they are thats all to know if the players can avoid the trouble they ran into before cotton bowl suspensions to two team leaders aaron humphrey and as well as kelly and i think texas will be clark the award will be presented live on thursday night on the college football awards show at disney world davis tabbed a by the football writers camp football foundation and sporting shirley in the next couple of weeks if senior darren kelly can regain the semester ends dec but coach rick isnt sure find out if kelly has made his grades and regained his will only get better with kelly in the lineup he said in practice with his dribble penetration and quickness he would help players like junior transfer maurice evans evans by has continued to look more comfortable in the longhorns offense he the big conference rookie of the week the league tuesday the junior transfer earned the award by averaging per game while hitting field goals including during texas two victories over antonio texas state last week the honor is chosen by a panel observers who cover big mens basketball evans had a on shooting threes vs antonio before points on shooting threes against southwest texas longhorn to reach scoring in each of uts first he leads the team in scoring and ranks
