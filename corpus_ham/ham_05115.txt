regardless of your political views this is a small but true story to give you an idea of the kind of man and the kind of woman we have in the white house right now as you may know the president and mrs bush visited the washington burn center on friday september among those they visited was brian who was badly burned in the pentagon attack mrs bush went into room spoke to him for about a minute all the time as if they had been lifelong acquaintances she then turned to wife mel who at this time had been at the hospital for probably days and apparently according to mel herself was dirty grimy and had blood on her shirt hugged mel for what mel said seemed like an eternity just as if mel were one of her closest family members mrs bush then told brian and mel that there was someone there to see him the president then walked in stood by bedside asked brian how he was doing told him that he was very proud of them both and that they were his heroes the president then saluted brian now at this point in time brian is bandaged up pretty well his hands are burned very badly as well as the back of him from the head down his movements were very restricted upon seeing the president saluting him brian began to slowly return the salute taking from the accounts so far about seconds to get his hand up to his head during all of this seconds president bush never moved never dropped his salute the president dropped his salute only when brian was finished with his and then gave mel a huge hug for what also probably seemed like an eternity as a note to those of you who might not be familiar with military protocol the subordinate normally initiates a salute and will hold it until the superior officer returns the salute in the above incident president bush acted in the role of the subordinate to show his respect and high regard for the injured man no further comments pray for our leadership thank god for what we are have and will be major carl ferris air force executive issues team
