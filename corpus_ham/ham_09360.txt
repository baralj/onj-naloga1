i understand that the esd is an annual simulated emergency of the compressor station on the lean and rich lines upstream of the plant by operating the esd valve all the gas piping in the plant yard can be blown to atmosphere by northern if that is done the plant obviously goes down and loses the ability to service its customers for a period of time advised that in esd simulations conducted in years past we did not require the compressor to be fully blow down we performed it in such a way that no at all was required so the plant was not out of service at all during the esd simulations this year however someone in northerns compliance section maybe pat longs group has required that the esd simulation be conducted in such a way that partial of the yard piping will be necessary northern has figured out away to do this such that the flow of gas to the plant will be uninterrupted with some small pressure esd would normally last minutes however northern would also like to take the opportunity to perform needed work on the northern generators the compressor station as well this will extend the simulation period to about two hours during this time northerns measurement meters the chromatograph and the two fisher rocs will be on battery backup you mentioned that the big power hog would be the gas gut is that we dont want to take any unnecessary chance that our backup batteries would fail and leave us in a position where we had to rely on plant accordingly my suggestions is that we should immediately investigate renting a honda generator or some other backup power source and call jim of for his input please remember that although jim was our expert in the arbitration you dont want to just forward our internal memos and correspondence to him without checking with me await the input of for the time being i am asking that everyone put northern v in the subject line of internal regarding gas measurement at the plant given that we still have a lawsuit pending this applies whether or not the email includes someone in i visited with mike and casey winter at the compressor station they mentioned a possible problem next week on october the plant will have a planned esd a normal esd would blow all piping down in the plant yard so no gas would flow to the processing plant for a period of time this year certain blowdown valves will be blocked so gas will continue to flow to the processing plant this will allow the plant to stay on requested that we maintain gas their plant since they have no planned turn around this year the measurement equipment will need to be functioning the entire time of the esd this includes the chromatograph fisher rocs and the ultrasonic meters since gas will be flowing to the plant and back to us while the compressor station is down during the esd there will be work completed on the electrical equipment this work could take up to hours hopes to complete the work in approximately hours the backup batteries will maintain power to the measurement equipment approximately hours the potential problem is that if the work takes more than hours the batteries may fail and we could lose measurement for a period of time considering the measurement situation we thought it might make sense to notify you of this potential problem thanks please call if you
