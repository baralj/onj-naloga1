hi how i see the passing game this where i rank players and to determine who to start i asking me how i can have a guy ranked highly on but listed under a that favors the defense one may be more favorable than another that mean id start the player with the best may have a horrible one week but unless youre sitting warner or your guy no matter who up against the info is meant to be just one more tool box when it comes to deciding between extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by info the points scored by position data is from get to game to avoid and passing game vs atlanta van pelt threw for yards and with interception last threw a ton of balls toward eric moulds although not many were price is also still a prime target te jay and will see plenty of short throws the falcons rank in allowed per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed so theyve pretty much been weak all year defending the passing game vs arizona be hard to imagine quincy carter leading many ff teams to this week if youve got to go with one joey galloway carters favorite target last week go figure just when he was locking on rocket both guys are risks even ranked in passing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to great but i just dont lot of faith in these guys being able to take advantage of passing game vs tennessee brett and the packers didnt do much against the titans but in my opinion you just cant bench rich jerry rice brown theyre just too good and are too liable to explode at anytime the titans rank in passing yards allowed per game over the weeks so clearly people are throwing on them for the year in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy to start your passing game vs detroit to imagine but stewart is carrying fantasy teams right been awesome and isnt showing any signs that i can see of letting one factor hed been missing he now seems to have in abundance confidence ward wasnt a big factor receiving but hes a great made the circus catch and looks to be quickly rising in the lions are fired up but still rank in passing per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to louis passing game vs carolina your rams warner bruce and holt are sure starters yes to guess which ram wr will do well as warner spreads the ball i dont see how you can have either of these guys benched as you a ton of points on the table carolina ranks in passing per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to the passing game vs green bay couch evidently had been catching a lot of flak from browns fans for a very accurate passer last week seeing as how not one of bottles thrown on the field actually hit a player or ref id fans might want to keep their day jobs couch wasnt very week with yards and interception normally reliable johnson came up small as well i still have faith in johnson as too much this year to discount him over one game the packers rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in allowed to city passing game vs san diego greens finally coming around either that or hes just with the dominant running of priest holmes green is finding room marvin and derrick alexander are doing well tony as involved as his owners would like but hes a sure starter in the chargers rank in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs jacksonville hits just keep rolling for minnesota todd thumb serious worry enough that theres talk that wynn the start stay tuned on this one randy moss has clearly decided lately and will wind up with season long stats thatll make all the owners wonder what all the moss guys were complaining about early carter is definitely taking a backseat to moss lately the in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in allowed to york jets passing game vs indianapolis jets are tough to call lately threw for yards and but coles didnt do a lot although call of coles shopping for yards was classic prime time highlights wayne was more active and of caught the td but not much else all in all a risky ff passing game material curtis martin should run wild on this colts rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs san francisco passing game lately has been donovan throwing to duce ok as long as they get the yards todd and james been inconsistent theyll face a team thats been pretty ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs oakland never thought id be writing about the pass happy titans but thats steve has been awesome lately and ranks as the in over the last games derrick mason and kevin are just about every league te frank is producing like raiders rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs buffalo tough to depend on chris chandler but last week he played very for yards and tony martin seems to be coming on a said we loved brian and he scored hes not on the yet to be a solid starter but he makes things happen out bob christian is an integral part of the passing game as well theyll face a buffalo defense ranked in passing yards game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs cincinnati managed with just yards sunday night picking for the ravens is as tough as ever with in the mix te shannon is the sure bet this week the bengals ranked in passing yards allowed per game over the weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to in fantasy points allowed to terry allen should be more of in this one as bay passing game vs cleveland cant imagine benching brett right now he seems to get better gets colder and they have a lot riding on these next few games to tennessee sunday antonio freeman and billy be ready to play the browns have been tough lately ranking yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy to passing game vs minnesota posted yards td and interceptions sunday and jimmy smith were as active as usual theyre two of guys in the league its surprising but been against the pass ranking in passing yards allowed

know what i mean yards and wont win real or fantasy games for anyone injured to boot said hell be ready sunday chris has tons of upside if youre ready to roll the dice new in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and points allowed to diego passing game vs kansas city threw interceptions sunday with another day like hell see drew brees finishing the game you might see brees anyway want to start taking a look at their of the future jeff curtis continue to play well tim dwight could miss another to his lung problem te freddie jones is inconsistent but if you hes probably a starter for you kansas city ranks in allowed per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed passing game vs new york giants yards interceptions and you can say at least do anything to hurt the darrell jackson is the clear although robinson will see his share of passes the giants rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in allowed to bay passing game vs new orleans threw an ugly game last week with yards and if a team finds a way to limit johnson game is gone granted most teams have trouble keeping getting his catches but the over reliance on one receiver the offense in my opinion saw plenty of but it wasnt enough at this point is the starter in this passing game new orleans ranks in allowed per game over the last four weeks after the st louis night for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed and in fantasy points allowed to the passing game vs st louis youre not down to chris are you even with a week to not excited about their prospects muhammad might be an some teams te wesley walls just doesnt

the steelers rank in passing yards allowed over the last four weeks primarily because nobody can run on the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and points allowed to orleans passing game vs tampa bay aaron brooks like you need me to tell you that joe horn willie jackson are starters in your league as well looks has taken over all of the work boo williams was seeing at guys are hot ricky williams reportedly has a hairline fracture inone of his ribs but is expected to play you have to think this will throw a little more focus on the passing game though the rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to york giants passing game vs seattle has been up and down he did have last week but only yards amani was the clear guy with ike hurting ron got into the action with a td but the rank a very solid in passing yards game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to

passing game vs washington miller isnt carrying ff team lately although his sunday werent bad marty booker is still seeing a ton of his way and white is seeing action david makes of what he gets but
