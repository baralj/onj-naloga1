vs the washington adage holds that a politician commits a gaffe when tells the truth this is how we read george w aside that new york times reporter adam is a that refreshingly incautious remark caught monday by an open bush was admitting albeit unintentionally that his campaign has problem we arent referring only to mr whose has been ably undertaken by journalist mickey were talking about the general media double standard every prominent conservative michael has observed the arent prodemocratic they will sometimes take a democrat to if he violates a media shibboleth such as but they are reliably antirepublican that is in newsrooms land there is noticeably greater skepticism and often animosity who are cultural conservatives or who want to restrict the federal rarely manifests itself in blatant partisanship or attacks instead shines through in the press packs definition of what constitutes the interpretation the pack puts on news consider the treatment of mr bush said back in the primaries that his favorite philosopher he was downgraded on the spot by the press for pandering to right the implication was that he couldnt possibly mean now democrat and liberal joe is making a much more vocal issue of his own religious faith and the same media that bush are writing long thoughtful treatises on the role of religion and any criticism of mr is accompanied with the the orthodox jew really is sincere this is a double take mr recent decision to run a tv spot attacking mr this was reported in the new york times and elsewhere negative primarily as a response to mr gores rise in the what about the hammering that democrats have laid bush for his texas record and even during the convention on mates voting record the gore attacks were reported subjects of political debate we happen to think all of these but only mr got the medias there is the debate over presidential debates this back and forth is perennial and youd think the press would merely let both sides out but in the coverage weve seen mr proposal to break commission on presidential debates mold is being treated as an dodge debates or attract a smaller audience mr gores decision on his pledges to debate on meet the press and live dont get the same criticism of mr bush is especially galling when it comes from of abc and who now whine that they wont carry debates held networks so much for their their reaction the debate commission is less about designing a forum to educate more about dividing the commercial tv spoils equally we hope mr with his desire to have a less scripted more open exchange with bush has given signs before that he understands his better than most other republicans indeed weve long his compassionate conservative theme was as much about as policy it was designed to deflect the inevitable of any republican as a heartless budget cutter also stood up to the press pack when it sought to hound him of youthful drug arent suggesting that mr bush should get into a pitched battle with corps and especially not with any one reporter our point is that wont be able to count on evenhanded media coverage to carry to mr gore hes going to have to make his case directly and subtly to voters over the heads of the means mr bush would be better off doing more debates in and above all it means setting his own agenda and strategy if in the press corps call it information about yourself create your own public profile at
