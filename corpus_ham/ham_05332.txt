ending his season now joins leon lett teague foot chad neck and darren arm on list of defensive players who have been injured this season is still available to the team but his status for this weeks tampa bay is still uncertain with all of the injuries on defense a brutal final four weeks of the season it would be a good idea to unit before the smith dal rocks updated who suffered a concussion on thanksgiving day against the vikings to start this sunday at tampa bay he was held out of practice for precautionary reasons but will return to the field for full practice of the week on wednesday dallas is likely to give ball quite a bit on sunday as they attempt to establish the run tough davis was matt updated coach turner has indicated that davis should be ready to play weeks pivotal east against the giants davis missed game against the eagles with a hairline fracture of his right return of davis is great news for fantasy players who own his with the playoffs just around the warner baja updated official rams coach mike has announced that warner will be quarterback against carolina on sunday this is good news owners of rams players as the team is a lot stronger warner is taking the price wr matt updated caught six passes for yards in sundays loss to the buccaneers been a major disappointment this season to fantasy owners who took on him in fact price hasnt caught a touchdown pass since week the titans unless you are involved in a deep league look a reserve te free agent updated caught five passes for yards in sundays loss to although he may not post solid numbers every week his consistent enough to warrant a starting spot in many fantasy on you roster as the playoffs mitchell free agent updated bengals have upgraded condition from questionable to next sundays game against arizona coach dick has not yet starter for that game although mitchell would give the its best shot at solid fantasy smith free agent updated completed of passes for yards and a touchdown sunday and the bengals applauded his efforts in the game his he was as sharp and confident on the field as hes been all dick hasnt yet named his starter for next sunday although recommend either cincinnati quarterback at this stage of the moulds wr matt updated had a huge day against the catching eight passes for yards of total offense and a touchdown look for moulds good numbers this week against the dolphins a team who he killed in the johnson wr top dogs updated led the browns with four catches for yards sunday although most of that was due to a reception that set up touchdown on the games first drive hes the closest thing to fantasy starter on the browns although the lack of a reliable will limit his value over the seasons final wr free agent updated chris palmer has become increasingly frustrated with weeks according to the akron beacon journal has too many passes and committing costly fumbles including one on return sunday against baltimore he had no catches on the day palmer to start the rest of the season but hes not a alexander te was free agent updated had a productive day for washington catching four passes for and a touchdown in sundays loss to the eagles the skins tight been consistent at all this season however so use another option position if at all free agent updated completed just eight of passes for yards and an against baltimore before being lifted in the second quarter for wynn we dont recommend over the seasons final weeks browns offense is showing how much injuries have depleted it this wynn free agent updated who replaced doug at the start of the second half of against baltimore wasnt overly successful in the plays he was apart of he completed five of nine passes but they went for just he was sacked four times losing a fumble once coach chris to say he wants to bring wynn along slowly and the browns reeling so dont expect much from him over the seasons final bal free agent updated was called upon during the fourth quarter of sundays game although he did not attempt a pass unless baltimore runs any of its next three games he will likely not see any more action stover k bal matt updated kicked three field goals sunday against cleveland breaking mark of and passing the mark for his career five extra points and now has an points on the you hear otherwise stover should be a permanent fixture in lineup for the remainder of the k phi free agent updated kicked two field goals against the redskins including what turned be the game winner he connected on boots of and yards and has nine field goals in his last three games look for success this week against the titans in game where the a major role in the final te phi free agent updated about a good touchdown percentage has caught only all year but five have been for a touchdown although he does get into the end zone quite a bit dont let the numbers fool you are in a deeper fantasy league wont be a reliable option comes time for your playoffs to gash bal free agent updated making his sixth start in place of injured had touchdown pass in yesterdays game against cleveland dont to mean hes a sleeper over the remainder of the season gash had other catch for six yards in the game and will continue to serve as a blocker a role he is king tb tori updated was rather mediocre against the bills sunday he completed for yards king has now gone two consecutive games a touchdown pass that should change this week when he faces defense with an almost nonexistent pass rush the cowboys have worst sacks this season kings offensive line will provide plenty of time to pick the cowboys secondary dt bal eric bass updated cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive sunday first team to achieve the feat this season the ravens defense another dominating performance foiled in its quest to post fifth shutout of the season baltimore held the browns to points and a staggering net yards the ravens also had six interception and two fumble recoveries in the game its probably safe that owners of this defense are already although its bye week next fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this their playoff run as the team faces weaker offenses san diego coming off the johnson wr phi free agent updated has been very unproductive over last five only only eleven catches and yards receiving none receivers including johnson is worth wasting a roster at this point look for better reserve before your small wr phi free agent updated could only haul in one pass for yards against the redskins he a real disappointment to fantasy owners who took a chance on only one pass in four of his last five games its time to look alternative to small if he is still on your banks bal matt updated was called on during the third quarter of sundays game after it was well out of hand he completed just two of for yards but looked respectable in a reserve role good news for the ravens dont read into this as a sign hell if any playing time during final three johnson wr tb top dogs updated is struggling once again he had just two catches for the bills sunday after catching four in three games just four catches in the last lewis te phi free agent updated was solid in sundays win over washington catching six passes for in the game he has had three consecutive productive games after a a midseason slump and should get a number of looks this week keep him in the starting lineup as your fantasy inc and
