monday nov at pm on the main mall in front ut tower for years the game featured bonfires at but the environmentalists won out in austin causing the end to for ut students in place of the traditional bonfire texas to an old story to start a new tradition in texas had texas kyle field since a group of students turned to fortune teller named mrs august hipple who gave them for victory burn red candles she said the burning of she thought would show the great support for the team texas and the red candle legend was born the candle burning lay when texas brought out the candles again the week of the and the longhorns upset no it was back in the boxes candles after that until when texas hosted a team that and seeking its title texas blocked an extra the first score and won the red candles are the most in texas tradition and are nothing to be lightly invoked wrote after the upset in texas was driving for its first in modern history and the possibility of a national championship hosted for three of the previous four years ut had been in position on the verge of a perfect year only to be upset out red candles one more time and ut won bonfires ended in austin late and seeking a new tradition the hex rallies were started for touchdowns if you count the return on the failed attempt last week in kansas can you help explain what chris that makes him so vulnerable to this problem also has chris set record in this statistic i enjoy the jeff intended receiver too early in his drop back he will look away from only for a split second he needs to look off the defense better and admits that he must stop trying to force balls into tight coverage from the same thing that plagued brett he sees a receiver or triple coverage and thinks he has the strength to thread a said he saw the double coverage on the pass that was picked off for a td against kansas he said he should have thrown it away hes learning he also said that his confidence since coming to texas an high so thats good news for the longhorns if ends the start against texas can you either give it to us or let us know where on the web to steve carolina sept at houston sept texas tech oct dallas oct at oklahoma state oct colorado oct nov at nov kansas and nov or at he maintained that two were better than one at this stage on chris recent games it would seem to me that brown and did a masterful job of keeping everyone happy with winning in a row also brown was able to keep both major and what do you charley davis that the rotation slowed down the progress of the offense early in mack brown said the rotation didnt work as well as it could this years team lacked senior leadership at north carolina his rotations worked because his teams were older anyway theres that chris is better off for having played early in the year is definitely still happy at texas no chance of him of practice this week and he is questionable for the ss hamstring is probable te brock edwards leg and wr artie are questionable dt lee foot is out and will seek a for this season a move that would give him four years benson in white uniform think we will matt there are recruits left who have either been offered

texas be if am i remember that when kansas state a few years ended up in the alamo bowl and ut played in the cotton bowl is chance of a repeat of that if beats in the big mike both teams will get into the nebraska would then be the for the cotton bowl and the would be the for the holiday bowl with the loser going to the alamo bowl are rumblings that nebraska isnt excited about the cotton bowl rather go to the holiday bowl that could send the to bowl and the loser to either the alamo bowl or the bowl if oklahoma beats kansas state the wildcats would have including one to texas am that means the wildcats would to the bowl and the winner of the would go the holiday or the cotton with the loser going to the alamo bowl opponent would be either oregon or oregon state the alamo likely be michigan or ohio and sammy davis three of the aggies best players are going to for the game and coming off a demoralizing loss to oklahoma biggest game of the year on a national stage it will be hard to that it looks as if texas has everything going for it i believe have beaten oklahoma there is not any way texas beats south crown is on the justin s they played well enough that they probably gained some confidence game the bigger setbacks for the aggies are the loss or of glenn ferguson and davis glenn the teams sack leader and leader at linebacker is out for sure with a knee injury that surgery if ferguson one of the top receivers in the big a top cornerback for the aggies indeed cannot play those are to overcome for am playing in austin helps texas but this probably come down to who runs the ball best look for this to be between and williams might have played himself into some postseason awards against steve if ut had kept throwing to him in the second half he did have reverse for a touchdown in the second half for his first rushing a longhorn but perhaps most amazing stats involving williams right now are that his seven this season have averaged yards five of those td when texas was behind or tied the other two came when ut was and leads and provided oomph on the way he may end up on some second teams because quincy morgan and robert ferguson have been pretty good williams will certainly land on any teams ranks first among true freshmen in division ia in td catches and yards per catch he ranks among true freshmen in receptions per game behind our soft defense on opening drives it seems that it takes or two for us to settle in is every team we play coming out in offense that we havent seen on film or something after the adjustments we generally shut everyone down with a couple exceptions why cant we other teams like they do us anderson for an opposing teams opening surge he said he warned his a possible opening surge by oklahoma before that game and sure opening surge became a surge warning about the opposing creating their own opening surge on both offense and defense so longhorns have seemed to be prone to the opposing teams opening settling fault for throwing too hard or the receivers for not being able a ball with lawrence he said he doesnt even think about it he said he just throws realizing that some of the those short dump passes are being thrown velocity of a roger fastball said he then walks over sidelines and hears people saying can you throw it any harder so to tone down the heat on some of those short passes his however were phenomenal against kansas just the right pete this one the has been hosted times on the last four have been played on the friday following is in day contests vs am the last time teams met on turkey day was draft is that if you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to find or change your password modify your account or comments suggestions c copyright the dallas morning
