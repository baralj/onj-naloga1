email is tom the worlds fiction writer have sold million copies and been turned movies the events of tuesday hold a special his best selling novel debt of honor in he created chillingly similar to the attacks a japanese pilot jet into the us capitol buildings killing the president of his cabinet here explains why the mood of is now turning to was a friend of mine formerly of the royal navy who first that the casualty count on this incident exceeds that of yes my country has taken a big and costly hit perhaps in south asia some people are and having themselves a good maybe theyre entitled to it like pearl harbor it was a and well executed black operation but you know the same mistake that japan made back in its me that america is so hard for some people to understand we most open of books after all our values and customs on tv and movie screens all over the world is of my country so hard to figured that they could defeat us not physically but america was not tough enough to defeat their that we would be unwilling to absorb the casualties into inflict but that was because we killed their samurai much than they were able to kill our men an enemy die in the performance of his duty can indeed be a but you see weve dealt with such people before just like everyone the american sort of patriotism like the british sort bombastic enough for our enemies to notice we dont thumping our chests and proclaiming how tough we are people like that sort of display but they dont seem to fact that they do it because they have to they evidently prove to themselves how formidable they our people like yours train and practice their day out in the field at places like fort and fort irwin california ive been to both places our people and how they train the difference between or a common ruffian and a soldier you see is professional soldier is as serious about his work as a surgeon his such people are not in my experience boastful if what they can do they will explain it to you usually in because they do not feel the need to prove anything off are like everyone else watching football on tv and enjoying beer with their pals they read books shop at the and mow the grass at home they all enjoy a they make the best of friends they look physically fit they are physically fit because their job requires it day they do something tiresome in the field working at or less demanding field exercise again and again and every aspect of their job is as automatic as zipping is for us people in civilian you know inside all of these people such as the fort or the ranger regiment at fort stewart burns a little flame not a big one instead like the in a gas stove and when you put more gas there the bigger enough to cook with inside every one of these something else something you have to look for pride they they are good at their work in the event they ever have to doit for real this doesnt happen very often and indeed they do lust to do it because its a serious nasty job the the taking of breaking things this is not something to be undertaken life is a gift from god and a lot of these people kids really can be found in church on sunday mornings but their larger purpose these kids enlist both in my country and in yours is to and defend their nations and the citizens who live there its notan easy job but someone has to do it and typically the hardest the best of us mostly they never have to kill anybody and with them its knowing are able to do something difficult and dangerous that their purpose defending their country is something they dont about but its always there and with it comes a quiet steely the eyes especially when something like this happens their sense of self is insulted and these are people who bear insults well they are protectors and when those whom sworn to protect are hurt then comes the desire the lust their mission even then its quiet they will not riot before tv cameras or cry aloud for action because thats way they are the point of the lance the very breath of and at times like this they want to know the taste of adversaries just dont appreciate what they are capable something too divorced from their experience this isnt like with your or setting off a bomb somewhere or people strapped and helpless inside a this means facing professional warriors at a time of their choosing and that is something terrorists prepare for the day of pearl harbor the commander of navy told his staff not to exult too much that all executed operation had accomplished was to awaken dragon and give it a dreadful alone in his country who had in america knew what his enemy was capable of and for perhaps he was not surprised when the bullet from fighter entered his head and ended his initiated last weeks operation is probably not quite of what he has begun as was because is now fully awake and its breath is too hot for men america is now fully awake our quiet patriotism is a now but it will not get too loud why spoil the surprise
