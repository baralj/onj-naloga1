itll be much easier this week against cheese vikings ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over weeks although these vikings did shut down green last the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to

in allowed per game over the last weeks for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to stephen davis vs arizona davis looked great rushing for yards on carries score he left with a knee tweak but it doesnt look to be carter played great after davis left the cardinals rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the year in fantasy points allowed to shawn travis henry sammy morris vs miami ran wild again rushing times for yards spelled him for a few carries and looked good too but it seems clearly the man here its possible henry could see action so keep on this one through the week the dolphins have fallen down to inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the year in fantasy points allowed to smith vs detroit looked very solid again rushing for yards on carries he failed to score he needs a little over yards to get the season so you can bet hell be gunning for that the lions rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and points allowed to york giants tiki barber ron vs green bay saw more action with carries and yards but it who scored with yards on carries barber was again in the passing game the packers let michael run and have slipped to in rushing yards allowed per game over weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed york jets curtis martin vs oakland put in another martin like day with yards on carries jets may have problems but martin isnt one hell face an ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the last the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to charlie garner vs new york jets raiders

the year in fantasy points allowed to alexander vs kansas city didnt do much sunday rushing times for yards hell be ok though and gets to face a chief defense ranked in allowed per game over the last weeks for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to louis marshall vs atlanta the question will be of course how much he plays but it obvious sunday that mike lets his guys play have really used the work but he warmed the bench while id say get at least a half maybe much more out of of is worth more than most backs the falcons rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and in allowed to michael vs washington when it looked like michael was going to take over the role thomas jones steps in with carries rushed for yards which was bolstered by a yarder jones yards on carries this was carolina though will feature a tougher test with washington ranked in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year theyve been though and rank in fantasy points allowed to priest holmes tony richardson vs seattle holmes ran times for yards plus the score didnt have a carry this week hell face the ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to smith travis minor vs buffalo is getting embarrassing smith rushed times for yards minor had yards on carries hes becoming less of a factor with each game the dolphins are in the playoffs but playing a different style of ball than they have been threat to go long on the screen passes and smith is a long shot for td theyll face the bills ranked in rushing yards allowed over the last weeks and in fantasy points allowed to michael vs baltimore said just needed carries and he got them sunday rushing yards hell face a baltimore defense thats numbers dont back up its reputation this week they rank in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to orleans ricky williams vs san francisco though he didnt score it was a better performance by williams times for yards the saints clearly want him to involved as he was sunday this week hell face a in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and fantasy points allowed to garrison hearst vs new orleans hearst was a non factor sunday with just yards on kevan barlow didnt do much either so it wasnt like he to another player this week he gets the saints who rank inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the year in fantasy points allowed to bays mike vs philadelphia punch continues to work had yards on and carried the ball times for yards been more effective on the ground but seems to be in the passing game this week theyll face an eagle in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and fantasy points allowed to corey vs tennessee showed again he can run on any defense he had yards on against the steelers hell face the titans this in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks so it wont get much easier they rank in fantasy points allowed to warren james stewart vs dallas detroit were horrible on the ground in this one with yards on carries cory did catch though so maybe hes worth a longshot pick there the cowboys rank in rushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks and points allowed to bays green vs new york giants was shut down on the ground with just yards on carries he did score go figure hes still too good to sit in this week hell face the giants ranked in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to so its a tough although i think green unless you really have a solid dominic rhodes vs denver dominic rhodes looked excellent rushing for yards on with a score hell face the broncos this week ranked inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the year in fantasy points allowed to the broncos are after the win in oakland but i still like stacey mack vs chicago went off last week with yards on carries and a be tougher this week against chicago that ranks in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to duce vs tampa bay receiving numbers had been carrying him lately and this week the price he only rushed times for yards and was shutdown receiving with just receptions for yards this week hell surging defense ranked in rushing yards allowed per game over weeks and in fantasy points allowed to eddie george vs cincinnati george looked the old eddie sunday with yards on carries plus scores this week hell face a bengal defense ranked inrushing yards allowed per game over the last weeks for the year in fantasy

in rushing yards allowed per game over the last the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to richard huntley vs new england ran pretty well last week gaining yards on carries just didnt get enough carries for this awful carolina team that any better this week the patriots ranked in rushing per game over the last weeks for the year they rank points allowed to anthony thomas vs jacksonville ran times for yards sunday hell face a in jacksonville thats been awesome lately ranking in allowed per game over the last weeks for the year they rank fantasy points allowed to thomas is still probably a starter inmost leagues but the jaguars have been extremely stingy of white vs only had yards on carries but did score twice showed the steeler defense wasnt perfect last week theyre though ranked in
