hi how i see the passing game this for exactly where i rank players and to determine who to start receive asking me how i can have a guy ranked highly on but listed under a that favors the defense one may be more favorable than another that mean id start the player with the best may have a horrible one week but unless youre sitting warner or your guy no matter who up against the info is meant to be just one more tool box when it comes to deciding between extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by info the points scored by position data is from get to game to avoid and bay passing game vs jacksonville brett its that simple antonio freeman continues to and deserves a start in most leagues bill was pretty week but dont look for that to last jacksonville ranks yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and this should be anice for and passing game vs arizona continues to prove hes one of the better in yards and sunday he looked totally in control of of course it helps when tim brown and jerry rice are on end of your throws both those guys look as good as ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last so this is clearly a diego passing game vs seattle magic was fading a little but he looked strong last week yards and te freddie jones and wr tim dwight could make it week to pair with jeff graham and curtis the chargers stronger while the were dealt a serious blow tuesday shawn springs suspended for games due to failing a steroid test really open the passing offense was a as well sunday in the passing game with receptions the in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and in fantasy points allowed to the passing game vs san francisco van pelt continues to justify my rob johnson bashing there is no pelt should see the bench once johnson is healthy in the gets the grease department eric moulds complained pretty loudly he wasnt seeing enough passes thrown his way van pelt obliged delivered in a big way including an incredible one handed fb larry centers is seeing tons of passes as well san ranked in passing yards allowed per game over the last four their secondary seems to be improving for the year they rank points allowed to passing game vs detroit millers yard performance sunday against the viking defense carry many teams to victory this bear team is looking more like the ravens to me with an adequate powerful rushing defense if miller is your guy you may have to accept these up games marty booker was a non factor after his great week white saw twice as many passes thrown his way than detroit ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the weeks so thats a passing game vs tennessee couch put up another game with yards and td reliable kevin johnson caught another td and looks to be an every quincy morgan did see more work than usual but is still guy by a good bit the titans rank in passing yards game over the last four weeks for the year they rank in allowed to so this might be a good spot for passing game vs chicago with mike providing quarter excitement charlie batch the starter for how long is guess and youd have to even a danger that he could be pulled for if batch luck if you can figure out anything the lion management comes up morton is the wr of choice and hes pretty much it is still seeing plenty of passes thrown his way if youre to reach the bears rank in passing yards allowed per game last four weeks but they did shut down the vikings passing attack passing game vs green bay is still hampered by the quad injury and is no lock to week if he cant go jimmy smith and will much has been made of the jimmy smith troubles can play i wouldnt be surprised to see smith blow up with game just a hunch green bay isnt anything special on in passing yards allowed per game over the last four are tougher for the year ranking in fantasy points allowed to york jets passing game vs new england should be rested but you have to wonder how hell bill and new england wayne and be aided by the speedy play of moss moss is almost a behind the other rookies though so dont look for too much from england ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last although has been known to have a few wrinkles up for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs san diego didnt throw any interceptions sunday but he only threw yards that wont get it done in offense darrell robinson were pretty active but it was alexander the receiving load id look for that to continue as with the conservative game plan the chargers rank in allowed per game over the last four weeks so its not like passing game vs indianapolis fought back nicely last week with yards and td the td was huge as he rallied the team from behind a shannon fan but you have to give the guy his due he pointed fingers last week but when the game was on the line travis taylor and are decent plays indy has struggled lately they rank in passing per game over the last four weeks they rank in allowed to passing game vs new orleans finally scored a td so what if it was rushing the panthers continued to look bad last week threw for and interceptions wesley walls was a non factor which is hard wr muhammad missed last weeks game and his return week is still in limbo the saints rank in passing yards game over the last four weeks and in fantasy points allowed to the isnt awful i just have very little faith in the passing game vs baltimore manning is clearly pressing as he tries to carry the load of he threw interceptions last week and three looked to be his the flip side he did throw for yards with a td so it wasnt this colt team looks like it could be playing catchup from here so you have to like chances hes battled the trouble this season and i wouldnt be too worried marvin terrence were the primary targets after a couple of te pollard now is catching fewer balls than ken rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four passing game vs denver up and down season continued last week as he threw for and leading the dolphins back to victory weve been wr chris chambers since june and he delivered in a big way with as we head into week its pretty clear that many of arent really rookies anymore was as well with yards theyll face denver this week that ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to orleans passing game vs carolina brooks continues to look solid he threw for yards last a td plus he ran for yards joe horn and willie jackson of the passes while te boo williams is not a bad choice if you need ate as hes seeing lots of balls thrown his way carolina ranks yards allowed per game over the last four weeks although in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs minnesota stewart with yards and passing against the it plus another td rushing hes looking good and has the he desperately needed confidence ward and looked strong although ward is the only one i really trust there theol is banged up but still i like chances minnesota ranks passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and points allowed to louis passing game vs atlanta kurt warner looked human monday night even with his bad game for yards and a td hell be fine as will all the rams was huge and isaac bruce was a big part of the offense atlanta ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks but id pressed to have any of the rams key players on my passing game vs cleveland with pass attempts for yards and plus td thats how whacked this season is he looked pretty it too derrick mason and kevin with te frank the receiving all are decent options assuming keeps the air so often cleveland ranks in passing yards allowed over the last four weeks however for the year they rank points allowed to the passing game vs oakland plummer put up decent numbers last week with yards td and with frank sanders nursing bad hamstrings its wr david boston is the focus and hes been unstoppable he had for yards and a td last week the raiders are ranked yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so this wont for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs miami rod smith hobbled on both ankles now brian is looking he had yards and td last week smith has injured ankle he clearly was limited last week even though he it clark and dwayne are probably his targets miami hopes to have cornerback sam madison back this would be a huge boost the dolphins are ranked in passing per game over the last four weeks for the year theyre ranked in fantasy points allowed to city passing game vs philadelphia green didnt throw a td but he did rack up yards and looked as he has all season te tony was active as always but wr derrick alexander seemed to be healthy thats week they face a philadelphia team that ranks in passing per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank points allowed to they have sacks over the last games clearly can pressure the passer itll be a great test for passing game vs has one of the weakest pass defenses in the league yet they shutdown the viking passing game last week you figure it out and carter are all too valuable to sit as they could go off at anytime but they certainly are frustrating my friend and local bill davies has a theory that moss was serving a secret one during the bears game on a positive note te looked to be very much involved in the offense again its a tough with that ranks in passing per game over the last four weeks the steelers are run so you have to think the vikings will be passing game vs kansas city looked awful again throwing for only yards it seems tome hes trying to prove his ability to stay in the pocket at any much better when hes mobile james thrash and todd with te chad lewis had several passes thrown his way catch any of them kansas city is improving on defense ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks they rank in fantasy points allowed to francisco passing game vs buffalo is a must start in any league same with has a bad foot and ankle but the early word is that hell play and stokes continues to improve he scored a td sunday and johnson is still very involved in the offense and in te leagues buffalo is solid against the pass ranking passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so it wont be still though and are no bay passing game vs cincinnati johnson continues to throw more times for fewer yards than anyone i he had passes for yards monday night as johnson was the wr of choice and mike saw receptions as well the bengals are surprisingly tough pass ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last could this be the week johnson snares that ever td of the for the passing game vs st louis chandler refused to play along last week throwing for just against a soft carolina defense i think he does it just me fb bob christian was the leading receiver but tony martin and shawn jefferson have to be considered week atlanta faces a much tougher st louis defense so that chandler will do well the rams rank in passing yards game over the last four weeks overall i wouldnt put much faith falcon passing passing game vs tampa bay these guys scott mitchell or jon or smith i take boomer out of the peter injured so keep an eye on him no bengal caught more than passes means theyre all pretty worthless at this point tampa bay ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for what passing game vs washington leaf era is over hope you made video tapes quincy carter to get the start and i have zero faith in him that means and rocket should struggle as well with to the press this team is in danger of total implosion oh ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last england passing game vs new york jets bill is looking awfully smart starting tom over as threw for sunday clearly the guy is for brown is by far his favorite target and the only guy consistent merit serious consideration in most leagues the jets are tough pass ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last they rank in fantasy points allowed to so it should very tough but has shown me though that hes youd do well not to underestimate if youve been riding him real hard at keeping him in the passing game vs dallas banks wont remind anyone of joe montana but he seems to do just win he only threw for yards sunday but he made few mistakes and michael continued to play solid football in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so look like a positive analytics inc all rights
