jeff russ lewis deacon king cathy harris mary mike day pam bass dell gene adams george original message are we having fun embarrassing our nation mr gore what do you hope to prove cry baby its getting nasty what to do if gore wont concede after a bush victory al gores campaign chairman william has indicated that if the recount shows a bush victory gore will not concede together with warren christopher have suggested that they will take the situation to the courts in case the democrats refuse to relinquish power here is a suggested course united republican fund of illinois chicago november herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george bush but al gore fails to concede we all know what is going on in florida and that the election hinges on the outcome i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will do if what i think is going to happen actually does the recount which will be finished by pm thursday will likely show bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush a and probably closer to if the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election this is when something critical happens either gore bows out gracefully or he doesnt and i can almost guarantee he wont these are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming they will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election in when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt sake of the country expect no such noble behavior this time what will they try one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the florida results on a flimsy premise they are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in palm beach county i have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least indeed they are identical in form to the ballots used in chicago and cook county illinois in this very election what is more it as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush inadvertently voted for all parties approved the form of ballot before the election the issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election while i hope this scenario doesnt come to pass i fear that it it will only have disastrous results for the country the election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court if this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed personally i am not going to stand for this and i hope you the good news is that we are not without voice allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp if they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials at every level with phone calls that demand gores concession i mean literally millions of phone calls we must jam their phone banks with are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult while youre at it send to your local newspapers as well if it becomes widely reported and it will that there is demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for gore to withstand the pressure he will have to relent telephone email email also be sure to call your congressmen and both your senators all these numbers are easily located on you can also contact another office to call is that of mayor richard m the if youve never made a call like this theres no reason to be shy they get opinion calls all the time and are set up to take them in fact calls it helps them tell which way the wind is blowing im hoping none of this will be necessary but i fear otherwise burke said the price of freedom is eternal vigilance this email to prepare you for the battle that we must engage please forward this email message to everyone you can think of if we harness the power of the internet by tomorrow millions of us will be ready s morris human events respond to this story
