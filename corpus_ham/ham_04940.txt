hi wild week in the weve got scott week downgrade waiver wire we get to that though let me throw out something i posted today message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second this season has been as tough to predict as any in and i thought this might be something some of you might need to our message boards of our message board members was justifiably frustrated with blow up on his bench while green and ricky less well as his be down on yourself thats the nature of the game there is noway you bench ricky williams or green for when a question mark last week you did what just about every one of have done im part of the game is it frustrating sure it is but its of the game in my local league last week i took a chance again freeman after starting him for the first few weeks but not week aargh did it play out no it didnt i had guys on my bench him but looking back on everything i knew with minnesota it was the right call for learned a long time ago the secret to fantasy football you just have the best info you can assemble make your call and let the players rest just like a real gm you can only do so you got beat because you didnt know terry glenn was out and you well thats your bad but if you got beat because to play the game of his life and proven williams and green well thats not your promise you if you can predict things to that degree you need to job and head to what you can control bust your butt to know all you can the best decisions you can make and be comfortable youve done all do after that just enjoy the games trust me be a because of lets jump to report for this a great week tom waiver wire touchdown passes in the last an upgrade in my book more importantly has yet to throw this season when returns from injury the staff will have a very difficult decision to make theres talk that might not return this season right now a pickup by any fantasy team needing a tim couch the yardage numbers wont win any awards but the in the last games is impressive couch is starting to of becoming a very good quarterback in this league keep in mind schedule looms ahead for couch however with the browns he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a looking towards the doug the magic continues to strike hes not the quarterback but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by into the lineup with curtis and jeff graham staying should be considered a top quarterback this season with a game keeping defenses honest look for to post to sunday on occasion passing yards and scores against a tough denver anthony thomas the continues to ride into fantasy weve been hyping him for weeks and it appears hell be named starter in chicago shortly with yards and a touchdown can the bears afford to keep him out of the lineup i think owners need not worry about using as total yards and at the very least more action even when is jerome has rolled to consecutive for this trend to continue with the steelers defense and stewart limiting turnovers look for to good games as the season michael we told you to jump off the thomas jones hop on the express earlier in the season with of the carries and more importantly producing all looks good owners ive never been an advocate of starting cardinals though after his total yards and a touchdown performance be the time to deal jason waiver wire terry ankle sprain may be needs to become the teams starting running back hes looked behind a pretty solid offensive line but his carries have due to presence keep in mind the ravens are teams about trading for another back prior to the trade now is a solid waiver wire david patten waiver wire anyone who rushes passes and receives fora touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade with terry glenn by a hamstring injury patten made the most of his opportunity looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to which is needed in the patriots offense grab him if you are of a david waiver wire had a breakout game on catches for yards more importantly for his fantasy value suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season injury makes way for to enter the bears starting youre in need of a receiver is the best option in the market if he is still johnson johnson has yet to score a touchdown this he is doing everything else johnson is averaging unstoppable at times however he did suffer a hip flexor in the game and appears questionable for this weeks johnnie morton morton continues to impress this season he the mark times this season and scored germane and herman moore out for the season morton becomes wide receiver morton owners should be david boston plain and simple boston is bigger faster and any defensive back on the field in his first games boston receiving keep him in your lineup every jeff graham with the san diego running game and a lot of attention the receiving corps is able to see plenty spaces downfield graham scored his first two touchdowns of the gained yards on sunday with defenses focusing on to find graham for more touchdown passes this rod waiver wire while michael appears is impressing on the other side of the field yards and with another score called back is starting to claim of best rookie receiver grab him if he is available in is the lone bright spot in the redskins passing gamete bubba franks franks has been diagnosed with cris carter all he does is catch touchdowns touchdowns in games he can start picking up yardage cam scored another touchdown on sunday to total to scores this season with aaron brooks struggling to find receivers in the red zone value should remain high for while aaron brooks brooks has been struggling trying to find his in the red zone with just touchdowns in his last is in a minor slump theres no need to jump off his bandwagon flip side an upturn in production is possible over the next weeks now were a little worried and brooks needs to be downgraded with crossed to see him upgraded starting next elvis two injuries in two weeks have downgraded this week without a consistent running game look for to continue for now is expected to be listed for this weeks game against charlie batch with yards and touchdowns many would think deserves an upgrade well if the box scores were the only this would be the case however the season ending injury receiving option germane gives batch a downgrade in with both and herman moore out for the season batch on johnnie morton and larry foster as his starting vinny was unable to get anything going rams on sunday with the rams leading by a significant was benched in order to get chad some playing in all not a good sign for owners are poor this season however he has thrown for in of his games this suffered a hamstring strain on sunday against look for to be listed as questionable on the injury week with the vikings mediocre defense coming to town be very happy with this recent turn of events joes email keep you posted on the latest michael chapman was able to rush for yards on sundays game versus green bay this is bad news for injured with failing to clear the this season his starting job is in jeopardy keep an eye on james stewart stewart suffered an ankle sprain in sundays loss titans he was limited to yards on carries before leaving expect him to be listed as questionable for this weeks game of a straight ahead runner stewart may be able to play on the be somewhat effective with this weeks game on the decide to rest stewart and get him back to health regardless of injury to an often injured player deserves a tim suffered a broken foot and is lost terry allen allen was limited to yards on carries an ankle injury on sunday backup jason replaced looked decent if allen misses any action may replace him teams starter with one good performance the ravens are options for another running back prior to the trade deadline so situation is cloudy at the current james allen weve been hyping anthony thomas for weeks and it will soon be named the official starting in chicago plain allen has been horrible this season with thomas gaining carries allen will be relegated to spot was limited to yards on touchdowns against a stingy broncos defense it was bound to a team would shut down owners should be he received carries despite being ineffective just a to show hes human keep him in your robinson robinson suffered a torn and and is lost germane suffered a torn patella tendon and is the terry glenn currently glenn is suffering from a hamstring he suffered in last weeks practice he missed sundays game the david patten show with patten showcasing his look for touches to be reduced when he returns from glenn was considered the only playmaker on the patriots can post dazzling numbers but his inconsistency has hurt in the past and this should once again be the case this scott role in the bengals offense has seemingly in the last few weeks after suffering a rib injury that out of sundays game started finding peter on basis with starting to build a rapport with the year from florida st scott now appears to be the teams in the passing marvin has been non existent in the chiefs week with sylvester morris out for the season looked take over the role and produce quality numbers with trent at quarterback fantasy impact has been minimal at is a starter on your roster your receiving corps needs tom touchdown passes in the last weeks deserves an my book more importantly has yet to throw an interception when returns from injury the patriots coaching staff a very difficult decision to make right now deserves a any fantasy team needing a richard huntley huntley has been named the teams starter after ending foot injury to tim it was only a matter of would get injured or benched again with the the jets pitiful run defense this week huntley should pay doug chapman chapman was able to rush for yards on carries of the injured michael with the unproductive from an ankle injury chapman will be given the chance to earn starting running back job grab him if he is jason terry ankle sprain may be all become the teams starting running back hes looked good running quality offensive line but his carries have been limited due to keep in mind the ravens are contacting other teams about another back prior to the trade deadline right now is waiver wire david patten anyone who rushes passes and receives for a the same game deserves an upgrade with terry glenn being bothered by injury patten made the most of his opportunity he has over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays needed in the patriots offense grab him if you are in need of david had a breakout game on sunday with yards more importantly for his fantasy value a serious knee injury and is lost for the season the makes way for to enter the bears starting lineup if need
