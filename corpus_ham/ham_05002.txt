hi the from our friend bob harris of the stephen will ask davis to pull the load against running back stephen davis has been remarkably durable he heads into his game of the season and hasnt missed a far the first time in the past two seasons he has been able to do davis listed as questionable this week with a bruised knee showing signs of wearing down after hauling the rock times who sat out wednesdays workout all together only took part of thursdays practice nonetheless head coach told reporters he expects the tailback to practice before starting and playing as usual against the bears this course no one can be sure how his knee will hold up against one of punishing defenses in the could be a problem because carter is still bothered by a carter has had just six carries in the past three games the need to get more out of him this week because davis is likely to rest than usual whatever the case might be the redskins desperately need davis to carry so far this season the redskins are when he gains yards fact that quarterback tony banks has tailed off the last couple is geared towards running times against going to be physical davis said yesterday weve got to go do redskins have been doing what they do best especially well the past with davis whose yards rank third in the racking up at arizona on dec and yards against the eagles last ranks a solid in the in rushing offense that figure would be even higher if the club hadnt struggled so an start the redskins have averaged rushing yards over nine games for the season only one team averages more bears on the other hand have held opponents to less than yards ground eight times this season including tampa bay last weekend on carries and chicago has only allowed two running plays of or more this season davis has six such runs this thing is weve got to go in there and see whats going to work well run some plays see what works against them and just worth noting that two of last four opponents have topped mark including green bay two weeks ago that day the for yards in a redskins believe they could have similar success they dont want the bears ranking or reputation but theyre ready to test primary identity is to run the ball tight end walter said were offense we take pride in what we do best its not anything bears are coming to town saying this or saying this we do what we do what they do its going to be a good physical football game our view the only thing that id add to this would be the bears have not played aswell on rush defense lately as they had earlier in the season they tampa bay down last week and they did limit detroit to yards week but they also gave up yards rushing to minnesota and yards rushing to green bay two weeks ago they are very in my opinion theyre not in the shut down category of like is this year or baltimore was last year in the last weeks they rank in the league i think than that but clearly some teams have recently had success know more after fridays practice but wanted to shoot this to you dont the impact of carters injury without alternative davis may be asked to do more than he would if carter analytics inc all rights reserved
