believe this generated worth of discretion with midwest gas unless i am not seeing something here i dont feel as though investing dollars to install or bullhorn would be a good charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the work day close so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings even if they were it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a chart even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing the answer is to install or possibly a bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined on these types of installations how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet todays business needs so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists and identify the costs to resolve the was wondering if you could help us out scott has told me that they have day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldnt read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume the reason for this is because especially in the winter time this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe if these charts cannot be read daily what can we do to make it so that they can could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these here are the stations numbers thanks for your help scott for looking into this for me i talked to jim banker this week and asked for him to check and see if they were charged for any penalty gas or not he said that he would let me know if they had he also stressed that we still need to see the actual daily volumes instead of average daily volumes on the volume statements im not quit sure if this part of the problem has been addressed yet or not please let me know thanks have looked at the invoices for midwest for march which total the charges amount to but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative charge which is for this occurred on march i was wondering if the midwest natural gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the and then if necessary we could make those corrections please let me know if there is anything else that i can do to recently met with jim banker with midwest natural gas from whitehall wi he informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes he showed me some gas volume statements that he from i believe it was the month of march statement what the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day ex at tbs days and showed mcf and days showed mcf these are charted stations with day charts the stations that he is concerned about are arcadia strum whitehall whitehall any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated thanks scott
