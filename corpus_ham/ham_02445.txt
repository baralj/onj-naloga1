off congratulations on a great assume if still hunt this late in the year you have to call a successful enjoy it an intense time and you slack off now also important to enjoy the moment regardless of what happens in few weeks tough enough just to get to this point great my perspective interesting in that the actual number of the material drops way off this time of year but the other side coin is that the interest level of the ones still reading shoots roof there may not be as many folks reading as there were but the ones that are here are into in a big do my dead level best to keep up my end of the bargain and info i can all the way to the week games lets get at to avoid and exploit game heres how i see the this week see the online will be wednesday and to determine who to start just because one may be more than another that doesnt necessarily mean id start the the best the info is meant to be just one more your box when it comes to deciding between extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by info the fantasy points allowed by position numbers are orleans passing game vs bronco defense i stuck my neck out a week with aaron brooks but he came though for me this week a great with a denver defense not been able to through the air over the last four weeks they rank in allowed per game denver has averaged giving up yards passing over that span with cb ray out with a torn hamstring will fill in for him again this week he and be beaten brooks will focus on wr joe horn his primary willie jackson refuses to fade away and is a solid option catches the ball pretty well out of the backfield te aaron is total non factor for fantasy purposes im doing my best to carried away with brooks keep telling yourself the young man games of experience on the other hand there comes a you take a leap and go with what you see with your own eyes this playing like a game rookie and the denver defense is awful louis passing game vs carolina defense i want to believe i kurt warner and i believe get his rams back on track as i believe see marshall at least see more action saw last week an but i think that makes go he creates so much havoc with the defense that must either commit to support the run which then opens the passing game if plays the pass then can kill them with the run or after last week be shocked if coach mike to kurt warner makes his return and he picks up where he left off not what expect but made a career of exceeding expectations if on roster i think you have to go with him especially against carolina ranks in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks for always tough to pick isaac bruce holt are the sure guys but honestly ricky been on hakim is always worth a shot too any one of these go off te roland williams suffers with so many good receivers but decent producer passing game vs seattle defense this one is a pure dan reeves makes the move for doug johnson over the chandler not a big fan of either but if you find yourself the prospect of starting a falcon this is the week to do it if ever going to the defense is less like a hawk and more like around mike neck awful over the they rank in passing yards allowed per game good luck wr as terrance has been invisible lately while shawn jefferson a resurgence a few weeks ago it was who was hot faded if you made me pick one reluctantly go te reggie kelly did catch passes sunday but not him for too passing game vs raider defense brought this guy back to life i dunno but you can bet coach is going to do everything he can to keep it rolling to be playing with renewed confidence and we all know that so much game at this level is mental no one ever doubted his the obvious spark seems to have been the benching of wr and the inspired play of ward i think ironic that very much a player in college at georgia is getting into the act and producing from the wr slot and wonders te mark caught a td sunday you know things are gets in the the raiders are an extremely good team but stopping teams through the air is their achilles passing game vs cardinal defense another interesting aspect of this column late in the season is that you can almost guess which to talk about as most fantasy teams still interested in december are with the obvious stars scott mitchell likely fall category and i doubt many folks are faced with the decision him this week but if your best this might be your first of all assume he gets the knee ready to go this the week honestly a shaky assumption know more if he can go he could do some damage against an awful wr peter could be a decent play too although is a solid cover guy hard to count out though just his home run ability funny how i see many people his times corey is the only other starter on but catch up with him in the rushing passing game vs bengal defense be clear no fan but the truth of the matter is got a pretty decent week reportedly making good progress and should start sunday because better partly because dave brown was just than has a nasty ring to but this bengal pass pretty bad over the past four weeks they rank in passing per game david boston has the physical tools to do and frank sanders has the experience to make an impact is the unit that made look like the rams last york jets passing game vs colts defense the jets have been up and bit but this week they could make some noise against a defense the pathetic colt pass rush only has sacks in games vinny had a decent day in their last yards and td wr wayne been in a funk lately week he went off catching passes for sure some of it was but garbage stats count too ward caught just yards passes but he scored in that game come on lately after rookie wr coles will miss another game it appears martin still is struggling to get healthy and that will hurt te anthony is a bright spot as beginning to in new york will make a difference to this soft colt team play as well in the passing game vs viking defense charlie batch continued to and went a good ways toward erasing some of his well deserved label with a gutsy performance on thanksgiving his ribs better and he had a nice practice tuesday throwing the viking secondary could have troubles with johnnie morton moore over the last four weeks minnesota ranks in allowed per game for the year they rank in fantasy to opposing the vikings are tough on ranking points allowed to for the year but te david sloan has well of late he ranks in fantasy points among over the and is well worth a start passing game vs saints defense for all the hype generated by defense they give up tons of yards passing over the last four they rank in passing yards allowed per game they do sack a ton over the last four weeks but they still give up the yards kind of unusual to see that be facing gus and a trying to find their way been up and down monster week game the saints continue to drop like flies and of cb fred weary will definitely hurt both rod smith and are solid plays as always and as crazy as it sounds either the headed te monster in dwayne and clark are too byron chamberlain normally makes it a headed te monster nursing a bad achilles tendon and play last week as noted denver gives up lots of yards through the air so this could be a high affair i doubt you could have predicted a shootout between and gus months ago but why they play the passing game vs packer defense torn here you weak the packer defense looked monday night they do much but on the other hand the bears will likely go with and been just awful lately like worse than dave brown bad one would think improve against this defense but great strides just to get reach owners of wr feel it too as the big guy has pretty much disappeared lately at the helm still though some hope on a does seem comfortable throwing to eddie who had thrown to him sunday compared to hear rumors may start a te but that news is unconfirmed at this in real rumor department cade is making noise about start this week but i think its still a week england passing game vs chief defense kansas city and new england are once proud teams that are struggling this week a banged up drew a pass defense been vulnerable over the last kansas city ranks in passing yards allowed per game for kc ranks in fantasy points allowed to opposing a knee in game but played through it and should be an eye on him though as he was added to the injury report this week as long as plays wr terry be a good as clearly the guy in that offense over troy brown caught passes last week so he may start to make some all those productive years throwing to ben you know love to have a solid passing game vs rams defense even if you want to pin night performance on a weak green bay defense credit still must to steve the panthers the immobile hung and delivered facing a rams defense that even with bud still ranks in passing yards allowed per game granted big improvement numbers may be helped by the return of kurt warner as nothing like the other team rolling up your arm loose wr muhammad had the dominating game know he can and looked overpowering the hamstring injury was be with him all year but he looks good to me another boost will be if wr donald get back on the field as are hoping for even te kris the one guy in your say like the gun has been looking good for st louis ranks in fantasy points allowed to the te so he worth a passing game vs browns defense this one really is a case as mark as good as many people think and pass defense as bad as most people assume cleveland ranks in passing yards allowed per game and for the year they rank points allowed to opposing which really surprises people is that their rush defense is awful and teams choose to run all you really care about are the stats should be ok but here as the jaguars look to take out a worth of the browns jimmy solid choices even the much maligned by me anyway rookie r jay week could actually be bad news for and smith were times when really seemed to force the ball his way te solid but honestly i think this will be the fred taylor ground show against a weak rush passing game vs giant defense brad his return week taking over for jeff george interesting to watch how spin this transition according to washington johnson nothing to do with jeff less than spectacular play or was the starter all along regardless of how george played this type of talk makes it easier to sell the fans jeff george starting next year see for the record a have been for a while myself and other guys are pretty much most players in this go either category johnson bad points this week on the upside the giants defense has to be vulnerable to the pass the redskins also hope to have week his presence does a great deal for the on the downside johnson will likely be rusty he may still some lingering effects of the injury secondly his best wr play but nowhere near full speed james in admirably for and looks to be a good play this well it looks like irving get the start opposite ageless wonder might do something if jason stays with thrash thomas is by far the weaker cb te stephen a steady although fb larry too many of the short passes go to york giant passing game vs redskin defense a good defense takes on passing offense i guess why this is in this the last four weeks washington ranks in passing yards allowed for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to opposing pretty tough kerry quietly played the last month thrown for yards and over the that puts him at in fantasy points among over that wr amani to play great football and is a shot joe in for the injured ike a solid choice as collins hesitate to throw him the te pete mitchell is tough to depend on as he gets more dan the it seems not too excited about diego passing game vs defense my charger buddies have about jumping on the that was right after sent email at halftime of the sd kc game to some friends boasting leaf of course we know the nd half go as well first and i came back to reality but some truth to the is becoming an i personally had doubts if ever see it think starting to happen and this week against a san he could make some more strides it should be noted the better on pass defense than they had been over the last four rank in passing yards allowed per game which is a huge where they had been for the year though they still rank points allowed to the opposing leaf has some extremely te freddie his best target but veteran jeff curtis more than capable think that san score some points so there could be some fireworks shy away but jones in particular could be a very nice francisco passing game vs charger defense the charger defense city down last week but i think that had more to do with warren senior citizen status than it did the charger d granted but i think san francisco should be able to move the ball last four weeks san diego ranks in passing yards allowed jeff coming off a bye week and should be rested his biggest problem will be the toe injury to wr was unable to complete practice monday and now looking like be later this week before he sees the practice field coach steve sound too optimistic although i can imagine for a wr than having jerry your best wr be missed but tai fill in there had been some talk from about resting to the rookie gio and tim would fare in i think this is just talk at this point i really chargers blowing out san francisco to the point could be gets san francisco such a lead that he could be pulled he probably earned a great day of stats by then anyway at least week thinking be fine in the playing time passing game vs lion defense ok this is tough for the detroit ranks in passing yards allowed per the games but the lions are dealing with several injuries in including safety ron rice leg probable kurt and nickel back marquis walker still crazy if you start randy carter just too city passing game vs patriot defense early to make a looking like elvis be back this week great chief fans and fantasy owners the patriots rank in passing per game over the last four weeks but those numbers are a as detroit cincinnati cleveland and buffalo were the not like they shut down the rams or will look to get target te tony on track after he was shut out by i think see that again with under center an excellent target too rookie sylvester to be fading instead of getting better he may be hitting passing game vs buccaneer defense smith seems his thursday and says start good all aspects of the dallas offense troy off tampa defense thats bark is worse than its bite over the last they rank in passing yards allowed per game although registered sacks over that span which is towards the top of solid though wayne james not anything exceptional te jackie week and david up with a great passing game vs jaguar defense one has to ask if anyone whether the majority of i think i can say fairly confidently that neither of these guys figuring heavily into your plans the jaguar defense has of late they rank in passing yards allowed the last four weeks and they should be plenty good enough the browns this team never really had a chance once tim couch went down kevin david patten handle the wr but i advocate either with a clear conscience te start for the browns but probably not for your ff bay passing game vs bear defense hard to know what to think green bay one game they look like the packers of old with his magic and the next they look like a shell of their as they did on monday night against a carolina team that had handling them as they did brett still a decent bet a few on any sunday but sadly become just an average lately the bears have been tough against the pass ranking yards allowed per game over the last four weeks although for they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing have the very disappointing antonio throw to although bill putting up better numbers the last few weeks he has in that while freeman will likely draw cb thomas smith goes against jerry remember came up huge in the with in the quarter for a te go with bubba whenever i say that it seems tyrone a passing game vs falcon defense this is an interesting game as two coaches in dan reeves and mike lead teams that are the one bright spot for the falcons is that yards passing although the is half crowd will point the reason for that is the weak rush defense why throw the ball when can run on atlanta regardless of the reason teams throw the falcons and i look for jon completely trend be looking to quiet producers sean in particular has been exceptional over the last few is probably worth a passing game vs jets defense i love peyton guy that always post the fantasy football numbers to match a solid producer very rarely burn you but subject to the yard td day with that said i think see good solid day from him against a jet defense tough last four weeks new york ranks in passing yards allowed per the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing will try to jump start his team floundering a bit they need a win and a team like this can be tough when heeding the about wr marvin harrison fine he last week and has stated he needs to on a although some help jerome some horrendous drops eg back this week from a knee injury and that will be good news and just getting it done ken catch just enough to make neither guy very passing game vs steeler defense rich garnering lots about the league could be but got a tough against a steeler team playing with confidence ranks passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing so the clear cut target of choice and that makes for brown owners you know get his touches andre get the scraps left over te ricky a guy who totally at your own risk just as liable to go score passing game vs bills defense a shoulder injury in what will likely be horrible weather the ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks what got in this game and enough me looking elsewhere if got dolphin passing game players who ever you did last week if is your if you have a miami wr roll the dice on the unheralded leslie more than anyone thought he would slim pickings with after passing game vs dolphin defense his latest injury in what will likely be horrible weather the ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks this sounds seriously this game ought to be a struggle as two dominant defenses square off in the snow against offenses rob johnson will get the start but as usual the game eric gather the majority of catches and too good not to start just because so talented and he the lions share of passes thrown te jay fast regaining place as one of the best in the game and depending on the he could be the best receiving passing game vs titan defense understand that this is a for donovan the eagles but so was last week against and all did was win offensive player of the outside of and te chad lewis i recommend any as starters neither the titans are an athletic and physical unit that think trouble and truthfully the washington game would have different if spy hadnt been hurt early the a passing game threat really hurts as tennessee will likely be able the with man coverage and commit more personnel to the run still if by far your best roll the dice with him made a season out of proving people passing game vs eagle defense steve among the last games in fantasy points per game not real solid see him suddenly improving his play against an eagle defense in passing yards allowed per game and for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing the eagles have the last games and while is tough guy to sack eagles will pressure him his wr corps in derrick the greatest as usual his best option will be te struggled last week with some uncharacteristic drops week he could be an asset as likely have a lot of time to bay passing game vs cowboy defense who knows where the coaster ride will take us this week nursing a back practiced wednesday and looks good to go the cowboys surprisingly decent pass defense ranking in passing yards allowed per course largely because no team feels the need to throw the they can run at will king will spread the ball between green not especially excited about either but very hard to turn your back on te dave a fine feel comfortable starting
