hi an avalanche of email on this so thought id share my thoughts i see this jimmy smith business shaking out this is strictly off ill stay totally out of the issue of casting any thats not my place and thats not why you subscribe interested because i know youre primarily interested in how his fantasy football could care less about a fine the real issue is whether the league action in the form of a suspension its my opinion that this unlikely to happen this season for a number of smith is widely regarded as one of the leagues good guys the is first and foremost a business and like any league takes its image very seriously theres a reason big bucks on all the outstanding feel good commercials featuring smith is known as a good guy with lots of charity work plus the amazing story regarding his health this summer hes a poster my understanding that this is a first time offense for him the a respected coach like tom is staunchly behind him helps the best public relations move for the league is that this be the theres the evidence itself while the has a pretty vague good of the league directive to work within the evidence of aurine test seems sketchy to me especially as it was not administered league there is of course the possibility for false positives in test an even bigger factor in smiths favor is that he will not with any is the timing i doubt the league is in any hurry to throw at smith any action that might result would likely be something carefully weighed with the ever present thought of the league from litigation therefore even if something serious were to this i have a hard time seeing it happening within the next few to be too callous about our game of fantasy football but i a lot more about this between now and week id be surprised some sort of swift action embarrassing i dont see a lot of real live jeopardy there for my opinion if you had a smith owner in your league who over this i would have no problem letting him believe what to believe and maybe scooping up smith if the price is again just my to our friend tom from publications for letting some of these things off a great analytics inc all rights reserved
