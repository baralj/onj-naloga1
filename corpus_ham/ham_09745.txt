appears that shelley will not be flying back to the states until january it doesnt look like she will be celebrating new years eve in texas but im sure it will be one that she will remember for the rest of her here in i get i watched pres bush new conference at ranch yesterday and of course he was asked numerous questions it never stops i had a new disappointment to learn that the us embassy in moscow will until jan so i wont fly home until jan
