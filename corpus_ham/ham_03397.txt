hi to get this to you earlier as many people had asked for it you have a great and joyful how i see the passing game this where i rank players and to determine who to start i asking me how i can have a guy ranked highly on but listed under a that favors the defense one may be more favorable than another that mean id start the player with the best may have a horrible one week but unless youre sitting warner or your guy no matter who up against the info is meant to be just one more tool box when it comes to deciding between extensively in developing these writeups stats are provided by info the points scored by position data is from our gray lets get to game to avoid and passing game vs san diego rated plummer as a lock and he delivered with yards and if only they could play detroit each week this week theyll san diego team that ranks just in passing yards allowed per game last four weeks and in fantasy points allowed to wr is unstoppable and a must start frank sanders played well too but had what looked to be a pretty serious hamstring injury on the check status as he has a bruised tailbone but good about him again this passing game vs carolina chandler continued his up and down season with a nice outing last the falcons to a huge upset over the packers he threw for and led the way with receptions a concussion but the early reports are that hell be able to week the falcons face a soft carolina defense that ranks yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for the rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy to so this is looking pretty passing game vs minnesota miller to marty booker looked more like montana to rice sunday recall the last time i saw two consecutive bomb to the same that sunday millers been up and down but clearly booker is a watch white and david are in the mix but this seems to show the viking defense ranks in passing yards allowed over the last four weeks so it looks like the bears may be able to bay passing game vs detroit isnt as red hot as he was but hes still a premier he threw yards and last week he spread the ball pretty well antonio freeman and corey bradford bradford had the while and freeman scored all are solid plays franks continues to be a non factor the pack draw a great week in detroit that ranks in passing yards allowed per game last four weeks they rank in fantasy points allowed to have to like passing game vs chicago youd been thinking about benching randy moss or you got your answer monday night these guys should always be lineup as theyre too explosive to sit against any the in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks this is a must start for these guys the only downside to carter explosion was that te byron chamberlain was left out of francisco passing game vs indianapolis dont need me to tell you to start jeff hes clearly one premier in the game is freaky good and is must start stokes had a breakout game last week so he deserves tai streets is not a bad reach and te eric johnson is getting in the offense each week its sort of like st louis where these guys are worth a gamble indy ranks in passing yards game over the last four weeks they rank in fantasy to and in fantasy points allowed to so the good the passing game vs jacksonville anyone else find the self destruction amusing the thing on the sidelines which looked like sweat to me and then posturing as the self appointed spokesperson shouting was pretty funny can brian hold it all trent when you need him will be fine i is always a good play if you can stand having him on your and travis taylor are both decent options as theyre of action and te todd heap even got a score lots of weapons passing game theyll be facing a jaguar defense thats reeling up they rank in passing yards allowed per game over the weeks jacksonville ranks in fantasy points allowed to year all in all a good passing game vs green bay perfect example of how sometimes the does not mirror batch is becoming a desirable simply because his team is so hes forced to throw on every down regardless of the reason you give this guy some credit as hes clearly becoming more comfortable system he threw an amazing attempts last week for yards and ill take that wr johnnie morton led the way with yards warren had catches but his status is up in the air with the james stewart green bay is nothing special against the pass in passing yards allowed per game over the last four the year they are pretty tough on though ranking in allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to city passing game vs seattle green had a week off to get everything together but you have to much can be done in a week derrick alexander is supposedly ready this week but you know how that goes id be leery until i see some snoop is still nursing an ankle injury and is iffy te tony is the primary threat seattle has been lately ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the weeks for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to in fantasy points allowed to england passing game vs new orleans bill raised some eyebrows when he announced tom the starter until further notice great news for fans whod a comeback come back down to earth lately with yard day last week but hes still showing promise wr is by far the favored target and the only real receiver worthy of astart in most leagues new orleans has been very vulnerable lately to ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to orleans passing game vs new england brooks once again offers some vindication for those including been sweating it after giving him lots of preseason hype plus another td rushing sunday made his owners happy id go with hand and keep him in your lineup joe horn is clearly the wr of willie jackson is up and down te boo williams is not a bad reach need a guy there he caught and looked good doing it ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last but be careful as bill seems to sometimes pull special to confuse young passing game vs new york giants have to like rich here against the giant defense that was minnesota last week threw for yards and sunday as in control of this offense as ever jerry rice looked half running all over the field and played outstanding tim brown is as ever this team has serious weapons and should go deep in if not all the way the giants rank in passing per game over the last four weeks but for the year they rank points allowed to passing game vs tennessee stewart once again looked like a real he threw for and a td most importantly he didnt fold up when jerome down ward caught passes for yards and a td and looks tobe a good play most every week as hes clearly the go to guy just in passing yards allowed per game over the last four rank for the year in fantasy points allowed to so could have a chance to do something through the air diego passing game vs arizona magic trick bag seems to be fairly well empty lately freddie jones last week surely didnt help even though jones wasnt to as much as wed like to see curtis and jeff with this arizona defense could be the ticket though batch discovered last week they rank in passing per game over the last four weeks but are playing softer than rank in fantasy points allowed to and in fantasy to louis passing game vs tampa bay warners a must start obviously as are isaac bruce and are outstanding bruce had the big yards sunday while holt got marshall catches as many passes as the just why hes the best tampa is limping but they rank in allowed per game over the last four weeks they do have the last games so theyre obviously putting pressure on the passing game vs atlanta you really down to starting chris i didnt think so could miss this weeks game with a shoulder injury that hayes would be the go to guy assuming his sore ribs allow him to gote wesley walls is always a threat although he seems to be less of the maybe he needs to have another fit and yell about the ball enough that worked pretty well for him last time rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four for the year rank in fantasy points allowed to they rank in fantasy points allowed to so theyre definitely passing game vs cleveland doesnt appear to be the best thing for the bengals but jon to air it out he threw passes sunday for yards and td interceptions the bengals have about it seems and all good ron got into the act scoring a td sunday is the but its a crowded group there making it tough to pick one player the brown defense ranks in passing yards allowed over the last four weeks so youd think cincinnati would be able the ball for the year cleveland ranks in fantasy to though so its not like its a passing game vs cincinnati couch is winning the real games even though hes not doing your ff team lately his yard td int game sunday is of that hell get back on track though kevin johnson seem to be his primary guys with quincy morgan there i wouldnt count on too much from anyone but johnson the ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last so theyve been tough lately for the year they rank points allowed to passing game vs san francisco manning looked solid even with the broken jaw jerome for the year and reggie knee is an issue it looks like his old reliable target marvin harrison keep an eye on te as he could easily be the best receiver after harrison ranks in passing yards allowed per game over the last and in fantasy points allowed to you never know will throw that monster game though so its tough not to play him on your passing game vs washington didnt wow anyone with his numbers sunday but he didnt in order to win the game he threw for yards with td is still the go to guy with todd worth a roll of the dice leagues te chad lewis was pretty active and caught a td so to see that the redskins are starting to believe in themselves rank in passing yards allowed per game over the last four dangerous game against the redskins who have nothing to lose and can the passing game vs miami a consistent rob johnson basher alex van pelt kept me from looking playing extremely well sunday with and yards and he a game clearly he gives the bills a boost eric moulds the wr but peerless price had a huge game with yards and a centers was also extremely involved and te jay caught a is hurting without cb sam madison they rank in passing per game over the last four weeks so theyre still passing game vs dallas just keeps losing weapons from ed to now rod smith is limited with a bad ankle theres only so much can do without his weapons smith is saying hell try to tough it play thursday but its very questionable how effective hell be if my friend and denver local miller says his guess is will dress but likely not finish the game after id agree with that prediction te clark needs to become part of the passing game here the cowboys are solid on in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and in fantasy points allowed to so its a tough here for york giants passing game vs oakland collins threw for yards but couldnt find the ike continues to improve and actually was more amani tiki barber remains a strong force in the passing that should continue all of these guys are solid is very solid lately against the pass ranking in passing per game over the last four weeks for the year they rank points allowed to and in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs kansas city posted yards and td sunday with the way is running thats probably enough robinson and are the primary targets but is really spreading the kansas city ranks in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks although for the year they rank in fantasy to bay passing game vs st louis johnson rolled up yards sunday without throwing a td thats do johnson remains which i admit is cruelly have to break soon though as hes just catching too many passes score i wouldnt be surprised to see him explode with a couple td games as the odds even out johnson to johnson is really is to talk about with this passing game the rams are solid ranking in passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks for they rank in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs philadelphia banks left with a concussion sunday but kent graham did a fine in wr michael has shown nice maturity this in there and now looks to be the quality wr everyone has him to be he had receptions for yards and a td last eagle defense can be troublesome with all their blitzing so itll be philadelphia ranks in passing yards allowed per game last four weeks and for the year they rank in fantasy to should be a tough for the passing game vs denver leaf did little to impress anyone sunday with a yard td game i cant get excited about anyone on this galloway could be worth a shot just for his home run potential but bleak overall denver ranks in passing yards allowed per the last four weeks and that doesnt help passing game vs baltimore is looking very iffy again and itll likely be has there ever been a good named thats bad the jaguar jimmy smith and although both last week with fred taylor out again baltimore should have afield day the ravens rank in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks but for the year rank in fantasy points allowed to shy away from these guys unless i had few passing game vs buffalo looked lost last week throwing for yards and hell have his up and down games but he seems to back more toward the downside his wr corps is solid with and chris chambers but its hard to put a lot in i do like chambers and his big play ability been tough lately ranking in passing yards allowed per game over four weeks its actually not so much an issue of them being tough is teams just dont need to throw to beat them regardless been putting up a lot of yards on them for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to passing game vs healthy enough to play guts it out through the game rushing for than george throwing for yards and td it might win that probably wont carry your ff team derrick mason and kevin both decent players at wr while te frank remains his the steelers bring a great defense though ranking in allowed per game over the last four weeks they rank in allowed to not to mention the fact theyve logged sacks last games tough analytics inc all rights reserved
