camps during the season has tb free agent updated could be back in practice on thursday a full two weeks ahead in his return from a sprained knee if all goes well he could the monday night game against st louis or at worst the season green bay on december its probably best to keep on during the fantasy playoffs although theres an outside shot he an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of morton no fear updated is listed as questionable for sundays game against atlanta with shoulder although he was able to play with a shoulder injury we dont recommend him for your fantasy moore no the fat bastards updated coach jim says he hopes to resign moore who was placed on saturday moore became expendable with the addition of allen and wont have any fantasy value even if he wr min free agent updated injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last sundays st louis hes listed as day to day but is expected to play green bay hes not someone who will help your fantasy team walsh wr min free agent updated is unlikely to play sunday against green bay after he on tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek he suffered the last sundays game against st louis but finished the game walsh valuable to the vikings on special teams and as the no receiver not a viable fantasy taylor the snake pit updated jaguars will need to evaluate sprained left knee this week before determining his status for sundays game he suffered the injury during the third quarter of last which was his seventh straight with at least rushing taylor will be able to play as hes among the best options back during the fantasy wr free agent updated will miss final game of the season sunday due to a sprained ankle believe it or not this likely hurts situation most as he was rotating in that slot against philadelphia its best to avoid any cleveland players at of the fantasy chi free agent updated who missed last sundays game against new england due to a reaction flu medicine was feeling better monday still for sundays game against san francisco is unknown so its best him on your bench this chi free agent updated coach dick may give the start at quarterback on san francisco instead of giving cade the final two possible reason for that may be that aggravated an injury was rushed back last season and didnt want the same to happen we dont recommend either quarterback this week despite him weak pass car the rounders updated who has missed four games with turf toe may be able on wednesday even if he is able to play sunday against san wouldnt recommend the remainder of the car fear updated hes most likely the quarterback for might for backup jeff lewis for part of carolinas final two games worse than a quarterback for your fantasy playoffs so of both players if at all lewis car free agent updated george says that he may give lewis some playing time over two games although he has endorsed steve as the starter lewis has a high cost against the cap so the panthers need soon whether hes the quarterback of the future on the other has the streak in the league at may not want to end it lewis isnt someone wed recommend during playoffs whether he starts or german wr free agent updated was unable to practice monday and may be placed on injured tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle he has no fantasy dt ramiro updated bills defense has been ravaged by injuries this season and showed on monday night although indianapolis did score touchdowns in the game buffalos d still gave up points once a solid defensive unit the bills are now just a shell of selves and shouldnt be considered a starting defensive squad on christie k free agent updated made up for his scoreless performance last week with two on monday night including a boot in the second quarter he of the best in the league and should be considered a on your fantasy wr updated bills young has only receptions in his last six games seen the end zone since week three against the jets what value he may have had early in the season is all but gone k ind the fat bastards updated converted on all three of his field goal attempts in win over buffalo he is one of the most accurate only two field goals the entire season starting this a good idea against a tough miami that doesnt allow pollard te ind free agent updated hasnt had more than two catches in any game in the last four at all costs for the duration of your fantasy te ind thrill kill cult updated only seven receptions in the last four weeks including only one night has become a fantasy afterthought avoid starting him roster allows wr ind free agent updated caught three passes for yards on monday night against the this point in the season has no fantasy moulds wr updated had another subpar performance on monday night catching only for yards in the bills loss to indianapolis in the last moulds has caught only four balls for yards and no owners who have moulds should continue starting him in the and hope that he can break out of this wr ind the rounders updated came back down to earth after last weeks one against the jets catching only two passes for yards on has been far more effective on special teams than as in recent weeks so dont expect much production in the final of the harrison wr ind the lie downs updated the disbelief of many fantasy owners harrison was held in check nights game with the bills he caught only two passes for what was an buffalo secondary a performance have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs if lucky enough to advance harrison is still a must start even colts next opponent the miami dolphins in the teams first scorched the fish for yards receiving and two price wr the rounders updated had his best performance of the season on monday night catching for yards and a touchdown in buffalos loss to the colts the types of numbers that fantasy owners were expecting all season but they are still too little too late to consider him for morris the fat bastards updated returned to limited duty on monday night after missing two games ankle injury he accounted for yards of total offense and a the bills loss morris will likely be splitting time with in the backfield so its a good idea to avoid starting either tailbacks at this updated got the majority of the carries against the colts on monday the ball times for yards his main production however the air where he caught six passes for yards total offense is impressive but he still isnt a viable option owners at this point in the james ind the fat bastards updated edge had a terrific fantasy performance on monday night compiling of total offense and three touchdowns in the colts big win james will face a miami squad that gave up yards rushing to in week but also kept him out of the end zone when it comes down to it the colts could be facing the bears defense and matter james is a must start for the duration of the manning ind the lie downs updated had a very like performance on monday night passes for only yards and no touchdowns in the colts was the first time this season that manning was held with out at least pass in a game if your team survived poor you may not like his teams next opponent miami the two of the best corners in the game in patrick and sam it isnt out of the question for manning to have another at this point in the season it is a good idea to stick with vols star and hope he can have a more typical peyton manning sea free agent updated is expected to miss another game while recovering from a this week jon will start again and might make several an opportunistic oakland injuries for vs dec for the rest of the make selection are no league transactions which meet the selected see all league transactions select all all all teams from view inc and
