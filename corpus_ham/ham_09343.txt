heard back from terry spencer of today that has changed its position on a couple of key issues first terry indicated that now agrees that the arbitration award is not limited in effect to just the past period they agree that the award interprets the measurement agreement and that the interpretation is not limited to just the retroactive effect it is not clear how broad they think the prospective effect of the award is but any change is significant on this issue second terry indicated that is very likely to ask for a special test of the meters as a way of resolving the issue and implicitly the issue of whether the meters are ok going forward this is also a big change as has refused to call a special test since the initial demand letter we sent them last indicated was drafting a letter that would clarify their position in light of that and of the apparent progress dave made stan has agreed we should hold off on the demand letter until we see their letter once dave gets it well all take a look and decide the next step thanks
