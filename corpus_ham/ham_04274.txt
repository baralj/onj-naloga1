ut on respond to inside ut football image rivalry is this brown the dallas morning news texas writer answers about the offense oklahoma halo penalties and much to chip brown talk about the longhorns colleges listening to oklahoma coach bob stoops news conference on are some selected quotes i thought readers might find were excited about the position were in being and were a going down to dallas we are more mature we understand more we and are better conditioned and stronger than a year turnovers were a major factor we had two interceptions that hit us the chest and we drop both of those interceptions led to scores i dont bother to speculate why they do something or not they run with both major and chris im sure well see part of i know who our starting quarterback will be be in there the whole go unless something i hope our running game is a factor in this game were quite a bit in our running game because weve emphasized on going up in the first quarter and then losing last years we set the tone early last year and didnt finish the tone theres a lead for three quarters and major made some watch on film that you cant we get and letters we know what the situation is and we q stadium in terms of seating capacity in the country seating some folks whats the chance of this happening in the near term waxer rangers wants it done and is willing to help pay for it so there chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years start by expanding and closing in the north end of focus would turn to the south morris w collie to be the top defensive end of the freshman class he thought be the best run stopper of the bunch and since thats an area to improve reese figured might play early on but de moved ahead of during the preseason and now reese redshirting recently started working at and if any more players go down at that position could time the coaches like him but might want to build for the future him out this half especially the running of kenny but i have a the punt obvious that opposing teams philosophy is to not call fair catch noticed this against nebraska last year and i certainly think an early tackle by invading the halo and receiving a much better than sitting back and possibly allowing a big if were going to get the penalty why not lay our ears back and pop in the mouth whether hes caught the ball or not a big hit that penalty a little easier to swallow dont you anderson houston but if you are going to get the penalty then get your moneys give that returner something to remember for next hate this rule colorado coach gary went so far as to say a team with great returners such as kansas state who has its better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys take penalty and keep them from breaking one or yards for a something come together finally or have i not been paying attention out of state and am limited to tv and had to miss one jerry running game used a scheme that focuses more on than individual players on running plays the guard opposite the was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks mack brown said had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didnt work but it rick bush with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle but im sure the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time those sprains can be a nightmare if they dont heal properly however no to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his the call marty secondary if quarterback josh goes unpressured the might need therapy after this game but rod and jammer have made progress each game if lee jackson hell play strong safety and greg brown would move from ss back safety that means goes back to the nickel back this game is good news for ut you need in the game as much in my opinion he breaks on the ball better than most of sara best defense i think texas has the better defense even without so i see texas winning turnovers will change the the game of course but i think ut is catching at the right time up some confidence on offense against oklahoma you expect major to start and play the entire game against looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an you think major would be a legitimate trophy he were to start every game and take percent of the two cents i think the texas coaches better start treating like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country which is and start treating chris like the the university of texas which he might be i say might because i chance mock play in a game he might be better than clint the first team in practice this week and i would be shocked if play most or all of this game in fact i think major will play all of the next two ut beats the colorado game will be one of those nightmare ut will be fighting a letdown and the buffaloes will probably winless the play at week so these next two games experience but i think will be back in action when ut takes on oct because the coaches are sticking with the notion two starting think would be a trophy candidate this season if the lone starter its just impossible to think of yourself as the in the nation i would think when your coaches dont think youre on your own far as next year you would have to think the coaches are going this rotation because they have not backed off of it much well see mock is still two years away unless or established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at texas become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks starters and insist starts for chris seems to me it would be less demeaning to to name and bring in for quality playing time during the game allowing him two series then yanking him in favor of the real starter plays the rest of the game the current charade hasnt fooled anyone as appears to be this is majors team any comments rogers how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the confidence by leading texas on five straight scoring drives of the against oklahoma state if the coaches are insistent about it will be interesting to see if can continue or build on the confidence he seized in the game after missed tackles and have improved but what i cannot why the opposing team can get so close to kris stockton and ut recruiting and athletes can not even get close this has us how is our blocking so different why does this problem persist chad much ground after the snap almost every punt this season has been of can stockton get the punt off before the opposing team brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team he says use the same formation that every team uses and that special prone to breakdowns because there arent enough scholarships to teams players and he says young players have to be used get tired playing offense and asked mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting a mental block now that two punts have been blocked this season he didnt know he said the latest punt block against oklahoma state result of players twisting and a ut player failing to pick up at least this time the punt blocker didnt run untouched middle of the this team will be in a year or two all weve heard about is macks recruiting has been and how loaded we are yet how is less than impressive and how the situation is hurting what most of these great players are only remember ricky didnt think so think about how solid we will be in two years players and the new recruits coming in so if we lose another game this season and end up in the weed eater independence bowl a year or two well be right in there so heres my question what take for texas to be consistently rated up there with the great right now as a friend of mine would say we have a good team building a good program it seems that texas is heading in but we have a little way yet to go what does texas need to be top team is it or is it about chemistry alex talent is there mack brown is recruiting winners but each of the to have experience and there have to be some the now the offensive line is still growing even though it has the defensive line has great senior tackles but the ends are the defensive line probably wont be great again after this year for years if you believe that you need senior lines to win a i agree with you texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse just a good team in the next two to three years everyone will put back up in the top next year because of their schedule but be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three now texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty of holding texas to the same standard as and but thats probably not fair just yet the stud players brown need time to settle into the system and get some experience next couple years texas will justifiably be held to the same standard perennial longest scoring streak in football b if i find myself looking years schedule after a payback loss at stanford do i need ps you may also want to remind your readers we should never about running up the score against u of a loss at in that is the active streak years schedule is even more appetizing than this years schedule road game is at houston the home new mexico state and north carolina and the big schedule has austin ut will have oklahoma in dallas as usual and texas no you dont need therapy if anything next years schedule reason to have patience with this years team good times on the view from anyone so in the florida state was in the season with a young talented named charlie ward of were winning the early games against teams but then they finally put ward in the shotgun on virtually every let him do his was like night and day basically what they did was abandon their attack and did what their talent dictated they could do pass often the run was still used but it was more to complement the know ut is not in the exact situation but this may make sense for only time i thought the ut offense looked really good this year was major first came in against and down the field and major took almost every snap in the shotgun the first drive i know it was against an inferior opponent that taken by surprise but they showed more on those drives with the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season believe you can win in college football with an unbalanced attack it with primarily passing and i cant begin to name all the teams that have won titles offenses also the shotgun helps majors biggest mobility personally i dont care which is used this season in or not but i really wish mack brown would just choose one and him aaron the texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced can run out of multiple sets i do like the shotgun the buffalo it all the time while they were going to all those super bowls you a lot with it but it probably wont become a fixture in be too much for mack brown to handle it appears he is already he thinks people are hammering him now what will it be like if he years game to suffers four mike really hard i think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash and forget about it i think he has gotten into a rut lately where that every question has negative overtones so now he is question by acknowledging his critics with some kind of has done more for texas than ut will ever know he has reshaped of the university with the positive outlook he has brought to team games are selling out players are coming to austin the the most part are good no need for mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has he moves on the media and the critics will move on too if he harps and keeps bringing it up in his answers the media has but to report it it becomes a wicked he also went to ut for track but he was a great receiver in high saw him on the sidelines a few times but he never got much playing time thinking he should be a senior this year do you know what ever jeff marshall looks really dry and during the game a lot of turf gets thrown mark on the field on thursdays but i agree i think the field this season than it did last season and we had a drought and the on it last year getting lately from exercising their right to buy out of the to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score u of h game and finally to wanting the u of h game moved from a stadium to a real college stadium where real fans can see a not sure about dallas but here in houston mack and co have been for everything i listed above and more rotation it just everyone in the media and even some our own fans want to negative to heap on the my opinion mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this mack and the players have been nothing short of genuine and media and the public they have expressed confidence but never their greatness in fact they have been the epitome of humility have any thoughts as to why this is occurring hook em marty murray class of we inevitably end up tearing it down maybe the sense is that season of and the victory over nebraska last year built up of expectations the three losses at the end of last year did nothing the bubble and then when ut comes out flat this year and said wait they really arent that brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations but when falls people want to be the first to say its falling then they add their own wrinkle as to why its falling so people look for cracks foundation to bring like in political campaigns the media tends to build up a candidate when the first negative story comes out they reevaluate and if trends continue that candidate gets torn to shreds it all feeds but inevitably there is a settling think the people who are quick to say that texas isnt as good as will calm down and there will be another story to cover plus get hot win all of its games and then this brief bout of criticism been for naught but sometimes criticism can be good for a coach and he can use it as bulletin board material to get the team going how mack brown and the vocal minority of critics handle things we were thin at quarterback last year and it was probably not but i look back at major and it appears to me he a redshirt year in which his only responsibility was to learn when he came in as a redshirt freshman he was ready to go your insightful newsletter michael r johnson houston texas michael vick there was no way a redshirt season was going to happen however wants to spend just four years in college and needed a backup for there is no question from his redshirt fans they sound like a bunch of whining said that i still cant help but wonder if we dont have a our offensive line coach according to the ut media guide coach has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior here he didnt play that position either there is no track record actually developed a line since he inherited experienced lines marshall and group clearly hasnt improved even though it was a major source after last season may be a fine coach and a great does anyone think that he is one of the top coaches in is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming we have committed for next line doesnt show any progress by the end of the year then to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs was line when it beat nebraska last year so lets give him some time with these la hawaii threaten to cancel the game with houston unless it is played astrodome or rice stadium also how can either school afford to give lost revenue that would result from a stadium game even do put in an extra temporary chris el campo texas an old southwest conference after ut canceled the hawaii game they will actively seek to change next years schedule it will be setting shall we him return some least midseason after midseason he argues that freshmen anymore so perhaps after midseason if ut is not making on punt returns well see some new faces back there i would see what williams can do although i doubt that coaches would put him and i would really like to see nathan back there heck i to see nathan everywhere from what i have seen the kid with tons of confidence well the quarterbacks less often giving them a quarter or two two or three series each in order to begin to establish some sort in your sept column you also said this should happen game chris started but was pulled early after an played until well into the fourth quarter the tv wondered aloud if was hurt in some way since he didnt get until late in the performance or was this somewhat scripted in advance in order to the reigns it certainly appears that the coaches have in based on the situations they put him in rick chance to thrive and possibly win the job after four games its hasnt won the job outright now coaches have to decide if this really the best thing for the team and its leadership i think they more on in the next two games and thus kind of disprove theories about having two hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once you have two starters its a real blow to one once you say that you have one starter i think the coaches will continue to say they have and play out of fear of an injury affecting know if thats the right answer grew on the job without training before richard went down in so who would think the coaches will again rotate after the and colorado they will face teams missouri texas tech and kansas will probably be favored to beat at that point if youre ut you that the rotation doesnt hurt the teams offensive progress the and game will not be on tv not even on if you want to see you gotta get out to if you received this
