lets jump right into our upgraded and downgraded players as we head home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines head into our week of listing these players inevitable players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list make understand what talking about is players that are moving words a player like te chad lewis could appear on the downgrade still be good enough to be a starter in your league it just means about the way he seems to be heading likewise a player like jackson may make the upgrade list even though still fairly the list of all about which direction players are moving an eye on these trends can very often make all the and downgrades some of these players are obvious moves up and some arent as clear heres my list of guys i see moving moving gus den you have to love stepping in and he did of course when you throw the ball times good things when you throw the ball times with a completion things happen look for more of the kerry collins the giants may be struggling but collins put up excellent fantasy football numbers with guys like kurt its easy to get into the that great ff from great teams not always the case as collins is showing its teams with vulnerable defenses like new york or san provides the motivation to play catchup collins looks the pocket and if he ever goes a game with both amani and healthy for four quarters who knows what might brett hes i said last week that coming the bad foot would be storybook material for a storybook kind of guy delivered and yards have the packers riding high they some noise wr bill is becoming wr and green is filling the void left by aaron brooks no i may be in the minority imagine that but i impressed with brooks taking over for jeff blake he was not a jim miller in chicago that knew hed be inserted any minute thrust into the game and responded very nicely hes skinny at big league arm and nice mobility of particular note was to throw to wr willie jackson well see if that continues a long shot but if youre desperate for a he could be a nice leaf sd hold the presses leaf makes a joe seriously hes an easy target and ill admit to taking my share but you cant deny the guy has skills yes there were some with injuring himself on the long td but i liked what i the on completions did make for a wild looking box leaf hes got some weapons in jeff graham curtis and his te freddie jones hes as flaky as they come but he might a look if youre dying at moving fred taylor taylor put together one of the best performances year sunday night the fact that he did it against the very tough of the steelers makes it even all the more impressive this rolling up yards on the cowboys or cardinals clearly for huge hope as if he can do this against he can do lewis bal once again lewis ran hard hes got to be of the better in the game right now i still worry about hell be but hes looked great lately averaging yards per for yards if it werent for that pesky priest holmes td here and there hed be even phi refuses to hand over the job to or anyone else hes not very flashy but he gets the job rushing and receiving the eagles are suddenly looking very good standings and figures to be a large part of that green id be a little worried right now if i were green averaged yards per carry sunday as he rolled up his incredible physical skills but now he seems to be bringing game to go with mike anderson den i hate to say it but davis is doing a of isaac maddening on again off again season know davis missed another game and once again anderson stepped by now you know its tough to predict what davis is going to week so it looks to me as if anderson could be a very nice anderson yards per carry reminded many of season hes running with power and speed and finally appears to the knee injury i think hes been over it physically for a while it seems hes handling the mental aspect moving willie jackson no new aaron brooks did a nice job after onto the scene and willie jackson responded well with catches yards including often times see a backup favor as theyre familiar with them well see if this continues brooks will get comfortable throwing to joe horn this week is still definitely worth a joe as i mentioned above kerry collins is well with ike set to miss some time should get to show what he can do hes long been a fantasy football flashes but never really having the opportunity for playing see what he can terry glenn ne ive on glenn since june he made me early on but had cooled midseason hes now back warming up again you glenn owners your patience is paying off drew a td but he did roll up the yards once again glenn was the prime jimmy smith smith looks to be back along with fred taylor jags awakened their night smith seems back in mark and the threat of taylor helps open the passing may not be enough balls to go around but you can bet there are james dal yes hes a long shot considering the horrid play sunday but you have to like a wr getting a ton of getting those looks from cant make plays without moving jay weve been waiting for to return to he looks to be on his way he was heavily involved and with new rob johnson he can be a vital part of and you have to think johnson will continue to utilize kris car no wesley walls yet but he does make for target catches for yards is an improvement from what theyve te and it looks like hes back and healthy moving moving steve car theres only so much a can do by himself wesley walls a couple of weeks ago i thought could but losing wr donald hayes with a groin too much his ol is less than stellar and hes just not having to throw king tb king swings back toward the side of mediocrity after yard passing effort against chicago it looked that bad too even offense losing mike for several weeks will not be as teams now can key on and steve ten not all the turnovers sunday were fault certainly had a hand in them his problem remains a lack of healthy a stellar in eddie george who can carry the load last year it from george but it doesnt seem to be a problem jake plummer if youre a regular reader you know im not fan im especially not a fan now that hes hurt as well he back soon but it wont matter for this team thats in moving thomas jones jones was recovering from pneumonia sunday you like to see a better yards per carry average than negative kevin ne either bill is psychotic or kevin a very good football player how else do you explain earning while his partner jr was inactive patrick pass got of the work but was ineffective im guessing its the fumbling his spot in the ron as weve said so often in the past ron is tied directly to how well the giants are playing if is leading see if theyre trailing its the show lately its been more tiki than and if the make some improvements on defense i dont see that travis prentice prentice got folks excited early in the year been disappointing of late prentice is losing carries to that doesnt look to change anytime moving robinson chi robinson is still the best wr on the team but the rotation is affecting his play with shane robinson had receptions for yards while those numbers not horrible theyre not quite what we expect from improve with another week of practice but im a little concerned joe horn no as i mentioned above i like aaron brooks a good bit is no way that hes anything but a significant downgrade from of special worry was the fact brooks seemed more the ball to willie donald hayes left with a groin injury sunday and his next week is uncertain hes a vital part of the offense and will if he cant wayne as the jets have struggled so has in another small game sunday with yards on catches just wont get it done for a ike weeks ago it was amani taking the last week it was with the highlight hit he looks like miss a game or two which is bad news for owners but good joe moving reggie kelly kellys just too up and down to rely on to when hes featured in the nice player and can its just that its so hard to guess what game that will bete anthony another jet receiver thats struggling as hell show some nice flashes and then disappear for im afraid to say hes starting to look jets
