game heres how i see the this week exactly where i rank players and to determine who to start just may be more favorable than another that doesnt id start the player with the best the info is be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between anderson vs defense if learned anything start facing the defense fo the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing over the last four really tailed off ranking in rushing yards allowed per game playing for pride and look for anderson to make a tb vs cowboy defense the cowboys gotten any the rush this year as they still bring up the rear over the weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game for ranked in fantasy points allowed to the opposing athletic style will give them trouble much like charlie garner the taylor vs brown defense cleveland struggles against most but especially tough physical rushing teams taylor and the jaguars bill this season has seen some rushing performances of this year you might see another one this week on paper a dream oak vs steeler defense i know hard to believe but numbers show that over the past four weeks ranks yards allowed per game allowing yards rushing granted fred taylor eddie george and corey figure number but a healthy tyrone too far down below healthier now than he has been in a sea vs falcon defense been a ricky fan days one of the best combinations of rushing and receiving time had an age defying season and the roll should a falcon unit been awful defending the run lately for four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed per game for in fantasy points allowed to the opposing wondering when alexander will see time but unless seattle out here which i have hard time seeing i think see plenty vs cardinal defense like fred taylor vs cleveland one looks almost too good to be true on paper they always that way in reality but got to be drooling over this game a owner his running in the lack of a real passing game an amazing feat hopefully for him scott mitchell can be the ball which will help even richardson anders kc vs patriot defense our support last week for a chief garner much support from coaching staff so it looks like another week of richardson actually got plenty of carries last week and promptly did very them richardson appears to be the better back right now but who this will play out hard for me to advocate either but if you with one know that be facing a pretty soft new england that ranks in rushing yards allowed per the last brad hoover car vs rams defense there was no rehabilitation method quite as effective as on monday amazing how that has been upgraded to probable but not just takes his place back on the bench likely see both rams still give up a good bit of yardage on the ground lately yards per game over the last four weeks that ranks them year they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing ne vs chief defense the patriots are a tough team to and coach bill is starting to remind me of captain the marbles while his crew forms a mutiny but if he can hold got to think has a pretty good here rank over the past four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing keep an eye on drew as if he go all bets are off but can keep the defense honest i like chances here of have to know the risks that could decide to go with or kevin at a moments notice if looks at him the wrong james ind vs jets defense the is the ultimate game of to see what others do you can bet the colts are aware of james allen had last week rushing and fumbling the new york i think see a steady diet of doing thing hopefully not fumbling though james is a no brainer against virtually any team unless so loaded at not george ten vs eagle defense philadelphia quite as run as their reputation might have you believe over the last they rank in rushing yards allowed per game for the rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing but you much throw those numbers out when eddie george get the hard way be very surprised if you see george leadership here and put together a solid martin vs colts defense it sounds like curtis martin is to have to play with the strained buttocks heard enough now spare you the indy defense is definitely vulnerable to for the season they rank in fantasy points allowed to this game will be in new york and the colts are soft when cold outside so martin could have an allen chi vs green bay give allen the benefit of the say the three fumbles sunday were rain induced although i martin fumble three times and he was there if he can find on the ball be fine as he actually ran very while when to hang on to the football green bay proved monday night they stop much of anything and this could be a nice opportunity for the for prentice white vs jaguar defense this is one of games that may not play in reality the way it looks on has yielded an average of yards rushing per game over four weeks that ranks them they also rank for the year in points allowed to the opposing but playing better now i believe and the browns are just playing out the season bigger issue is travis prentice is fighting for playing time as has looked impressive a decent for cleveland but shy from these guys if it were vs bengal defense a case of both sides being better what many people think michael is a player since left been pretty much show on the ground much to of thomas jones owners and on the other side of the ball the are a better defense than they get credit for on the ground in rushing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks year they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing once could truly go either way feel ok with if he but i be overly smith min vs lion defense this the best in for smith but you have to start him if nothing else than to get lead on your opponent with a thursday night game seriously smith is one of the elite right now is playing pretty tough against the run ranking in allowed per game over the last four weeks a starter play green vs bear defense find a nice toasty place to watch chicago in december at night football with gone for the year the packers are looking to green to be the has a tough run defense led by all world rookie brian you this summer my cab driver in chicago was calling him and now seeing why i love this kid these guys but i can promise you green thinks about the hard hitting the wild eyes lined up across the way from him as the smith mia vs bills defense smith practiced wednesday and while awful early to make a definitive call it looks like start defense is solid against the rush they rank in rushing allowed per game over the last four weeks although for the year in fantasy points allowed to the opposing although if return to his awesome form before the injury be a load will rely on the running game with jay likely rusty that good to begin vs panther defense hope gets back form and hope the panther defense gets back more their defense form over the last four games carolina ranks yards allowed per game but for the year they come in at points allowed to the opposing it sounds to me like coach make the mistake again of one of his best sammy morris smith vs miami it or not the dolphin defense ranks just in rushing per game over the last four weeks granted of those games zach thomas but that number is still higher than i would have the bills rushing game is a mess the team is calling questionable so have to wait and see has done with the opportunity and we know smith produce or we never seen so much of and morris with a healthy zach probably shy a bit from any of these smith dal vs buccaneer defense smith said never been out in his career but what happened thursday quickly and says certainly be the starter sunday the but not invincible over the last four weeks they rank yards allowed per game giving up yards per game on the made a living running the ball against tough defenses over so not overly concerned with the a gamer and probably a starter for most owners this week even facing davis was vs giants defense be very leery here stephen last week that you have to take what he says with a grain players are notoriously optimistic about their chances for injury unless i could turn my lineup in very late this week and i start think very hard about going elsewhere this week like facing seattle and this is a dream or are tough against the run ranking for the year in fantasy to the opposing so unless you know for sure going consider my other fletcher sd vs defense fletcher is probable with a rib which must sound worse than it is either that or one the problem is that san francisco is playing much improved against the rush over the last four weeks they rank in allowed per game a marked contrast to their year where they rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing ribs to the improved defense i see much from on the ground tiki barber vs redskins to me barber is looking favorable in this game simply based on the opinion i see a lead where they can grind out the clock if a painfully aware that coach jim puts on the shelf of barber when his team trails the giants are a good team but i see them jumping all over washington plus the redskins play very defense for the year they rank in fantasy points allowed to and over the last four weeks they rank in rushing per stewart det vs viking defense great game against tampa taught me not to discount him too much based on but got a tough situation here minnesota over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game for the year they rank points allowed to the opposing part of that has to do with explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch part of it is that the vikings are just improved there lb dwayne miss the game with a bad shoulder so that favors detroit but not overly excited about the still though stewart is the better backs and think likely a starter for your loaded with stanley phi vs titan defense the eagle been very little factor and i see them all of a sudden a very tough tennessee defense especially one in a foul mood after last second loss from the kicker a tough job but carries this team almost solely on his shoulders he could be the leading rusher again as tennessee puts the clamps on the for the titans rank in fantasy points allowed to the opposing anderson den vs saints defense i like mike anderson and story but got a very tough this week with new saints rank for the year in fantasy points allowed to the and over the last four games they rank in rushing yards allowed just averaged yards per game allowed rushing anderson probably worth a start unless really deep at but just facing a tough garner sf vs charger defense with a week off to prepare garner back to face a rejuvenated charger team coming off their first playing rush defense like accustomed to seeing diego ranking in rushing yards allowed per game over the last garner your normal back but facing a tough game here still start him as got that big play potential with the ability to distance at any time but not excited about the pit vs raider defense jerome was built for down defenses in the december cold but have a tough week against oakland the raiders rank over the last four rushing yards allowed per game partly why their passing defense be able to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly moore chad morton no vs bronco defense assuming moore is his neck stinger be running behind his outstanding ol but a tough against the denver defense remained tough vs over the last four weeks they rank in rushing yards allowed allowing an average of yards per game ricky and managed to post against them sunday moore looks to get of carries and work so the better option at assuming he can go but even healthy got his work cut out
