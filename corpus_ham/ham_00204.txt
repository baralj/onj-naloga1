the friday fun than a fortune cookie and at least as those folks smoking he asked in an outrage my friend in houston has trouble understanding the workings of our here in california in fact so do i committee on energy and natural resources did nothing either or my understanding of the national is perpetrating with electricity next thing you know they will be taking property and to build power plants and he mused between dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers to it dave they did say something about that i peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing or the utilities to build and not let the market i remember if that was before or after he suggested to that the iso and the should be folded into under the direction of the electric oversight know what you are thinking right now the next thing you will have regulated retail rates that recipe should be the oven sometime next the power marketers are jigging the system bidding up to bid cap there is no way you can tell me that a to make in its pro dave added you herr hair peace you believe in i retorted believe in them but i remember when i was short on a mw without any notice or advanced warning the price in the went against dave recalled called everyone who i and they had nothing i finally called and i asked it cost for you ask for i wondered want him you get hosed when you show the buyer your position ask dave they offered to sell for i said it and then said i needed another fifty he asked i and he priced the next mw at lamented dave to see how far he could push me what i mean when i traders are jigging dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function mitigates the risk the traders are the in between people who the price sometimes they guess right and sometimes they but the damage or the reward is on their book not passed onto the ultimate consumer it has nothing to do with the marginal cost generating there you have it put in a price cap and the traders have for which to shoot i prove the following yet but with any of you that as the price cap level dips down the price climbs even as the price eliminated consumers get hosed and the fundamental is upheld which is one can never be made better off with of an additional feel better already here is what is on our short agenda this week things in the mailbag things in the republic of california the iso replies to the report reflections on a day of senate hearings issues oii on functioning of wholesale market odds ends things in the has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a is what my friends have been writing steve ponder was only too quick to tell me more whining about your computer how old are you is this you get the letter a very depressing moment do you know how to spell morro bay please let us know what is going your sons hockey team dont forget the cigars for is good to have friends like steve they make the pain of much easier and steve when you guys get that out in a dozen years or so you let us know i want in the name selection for the new entity how from the mark who writes youve heard i dont know quite how you manage to knock out all this week the burrito is informative humorous and usually contains of irony tragedy iso drama though you are usually the you are not unduly negative which i appreciate we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in forget the amount effort and challenge it took the open this mark i just want you to know that my ability to write every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence i from watching herr hair peace that as long as you can too fast and have conviction in your statements regardless groundless they may be you will have a willing and eager few weeks ago i received from the jennifer a she wants you to know are her opinions not necessarily the okay jennifer i paid the i owed him sham rose bowl bet remember stanford lost and your cool with us curious has anyone been comparing prices to high ca electricity prices what i mean is we in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate san who cant afford to keep the ac on but what about the gas prices the whole country has seen over the last no effort is made by the government to shield the consumer much it costs to fill their gas tank no mention is made of cant afford to drive to the grocery store because they cant extra or cents a gallon the costs are passed along to without pause granted there are differences between market and the electricity market in terms of but then again is it that much different to say drive today because gas is too cant turn up the ac today because its too from one of our secret washington readers and i am iso governing board discussion and vote ugh i too noted speak fast was applied to everyone but herr peace my a mess we have i loved picture in usa today it my sources at tell me though that we should keep an for chairman to do something really censored for political reasons given no commission meetings til only way to act is by unanimous consent so i would hope he cant that things in the republic of california the iso replies to the of you people commented to me that the reply to report was very good i decided to excerpt the best sections for the burrito the full document can be found on the the report asserts that the suspected activities generators on june created frequency instability leading bay area blackouts the following day in fact the events of june june were completely independent of one another the on june was caused by system conditions on that day area and transmission constraints that prevented the import from outside the report states that the iso to call upon consumers demand in order to avoid the bay area blackouts in fact the in place on june a number of demand response programs designed load including the summer demand response program customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to use in exchange for a report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid of energy as a result of the recent price spikes eg in the month of june alone these assertions leave one with impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid andor passed through to customers however in determining cost of energy one must determine the impact of any entered into by the in advance of the wholesale these contracts which are designed to a in advance of or near market activities designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility standard in all commodities markets we have reason to believe of the were substantially hedged during the period of price a similar vein the reports asserts that california saved million dollars had a price cap been in place and june this assertion assumes that all energy purchases been made at or below the bid cap in fact during times demand when all of the generation has been exhausted competes with neighboring regions for available generation in secure the necessary power the iso must purchase on a this energy from resources located outside of the report asserts that california power markets not and implies erroneously in our view that this is state of affairs it is not the market surveillance noted that power in the california energy market appears during periods of peak and warned that demand increase the incidence of market power during the summer of report asserts that the iso is answerable only to a and not to the citizens of california this simply is not the iso is subject to the provisions of the federal power act the rules and regulations of which dictate in part energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the the iso further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed by every change to our market design and virtually of the business is subject to review and scrutiny by process provides substantial opportunities for input by agencies and such agencies have in fact been active the report asserts that california supply conditions have been restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have more vulnerable to supply shortages this assertion significant load growth in california and neighboring with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in and transmission have caused this has increased proposed power plant applications many by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements significant shortage be things in the republic of california reflections on a day of senate you want to imagine a scary sight imagine then twelve gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the electric restructuring also imagine as if you are in the witnesses that are slow on their feet and reckless in then you get a glimpse of what joint was started over two hours late the senate was busy congratulating their own who is out next session and they wanted on the glory that said the show began with commissioner mr has one story and regardless how well he tells he does it is always the same story it is the heat storm can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is call her ladybird who travels across an angry her precocious preteen child they for electric power plants in the dessert which by the god have been shipped to other countries which have more on the first speaker mr took at least half the heat the day the rage of the energy fuhrer was palpable last week shed mw of load last week to save the entire system and receive one penny of compensation not making that up it he is sick of hearing about demand management as being for the problem over the last five years and he is about people in san diego are depressed by the sudden did mention that the california reserve margin has sunk to butin neighboring arizona the reserve margin is or mr pointed out that electric power is not solely a it is a regional problem one member of the committee the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting referred to governor gray executive order issued last which the plans to respond soon date uncertain that lays out month permitting time line the six months are enough if has the land secured zoning okayed transmission access offsets that alone might take six months before you the next panel included mr of the and ms lynch i went on her last week calling her do lynch that was a i promise to be nicer starting now the energy ms lynch to use her authority to order to divert through of funds from the customers to the until the the market is cured put it in an escrow account ms lynch review this option at her august meeting where she will rate caps told star of the day i thought was general counsel doug smith comes to sacramento that a switch mr smith came of mr thank the lord mr smith put into legislators could not get through their heads any other angry legislators were looking for a way for to declare market as noncompetitive and then ask the generators to the money they over collected when can we do that mr as only a attorney can answer there is a process time you must have evidence uses a assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable on market concentration and dominance not the existence of you would have to sue in federal court and the best hope for is for to reconsider its decision upon remand us court of the wind came out of the sails of the gang of they herr hair peace screamed you mr smith of use your authority to declare the markets noncompetitive who had market based rates have exercised market power implement a rate cap across the western a wheezing accordion mr smith played back and forth the of music like a solo street musician on the corner back past i hated the process at today i have a renewed what process affords me and you freedom from the tyranny of the remainder of the hearing they focused on remedies that could by the things in the republic of california issues oii on functioning of wholesale the official title is instituting investigation into of the
